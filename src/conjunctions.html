<p>
  A conjunction is a part of speech that connects words, phrases, or clauses. It shows the relationship between the connected elements, such as addition, contrast, or cause.
</p>
<p>
  It might overlap with other parts of speech.
</p>
<p>
  There are only a handful of conjunctions attested in Sindarin, and a few neologisms:

<h3>
  When to <i>not</i> use "and"
</h3>
<p>
  In a discussion of various Quenya words for "and" from the late 1960s (PE17/70–1), Tolkien said that the usual English habit of placing the equivalent of "and" before the final item of a list, while omitting it before the other items would in Quenya represent a discontinuity.
</p>
<p>
  The same concept applies to Sindarin, as can be observed in the King’s Letter:
</p>
  Elanor, Meril, Glorfinniel, Eirien sellath dîn and Iorhael, Gelir, Cordof, Baravorn ionnath dîn omit the “and” present in their English equivalents: “Elanor, Rose, Goldilocks and Daisy his daughters” and “Frodo, Merry, Pippin and Hamfast his sons”.

In a discussion of various Quenya words for “and” from the late 1960s (PE17/70–1) Tolkien says that the usual English habit of placing the equivalent of “and” before the final item of a list while omitting it before the other items would in Quenya represent a discontinuity, so that in the Quenya rendering of such a sentence as “Gandalf, Aragorn, Eomer and Imrahil in grey, in silver, in green, and in blue” the “and” before “Imrahil” and “in blue” would be omitted. The same feature of syntax can be seen in the latest version of the King’s Letter from the early 1950s, where the Sindarin phrases Elanor, Meril, Glorfinniel, Eirien sellath dîn and Iorhael, Gelir, Cordof, Baravorn ionnath dîn omit the “and” present in their English equivalents: “Elanor, Rose, Goldilocks and Daisy his daughters” and “Frodo, Merry, Pippin and Hamfast his sons”.
