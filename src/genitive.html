<p>
  In grammar, a genitive construction or genitival construction is used to express a relation between two nouns such as the possession of one by another, or an attributive relationship. A genitive construction involves two nouns, the head (or modified noun) and the dependent (or modifier noun).
</p>
<p>
  Sindarin's most used style of genitive constructions is by juxtaposition, similar to Hebrew.
</p>

<h4>Juxtapositional genitives</h4>
<p>
  These function adjectivally and hence the modifying noun is always indefinite.
</p>
<p>
  Juxtapositional genitives are always used for nouns in apposition, that is, two nouns referencing the same thing:
</p>
<pre>
  "ost Minas Tirith" = "city [of] Minas Tirith"
</pre>

<h5>
  Definiteness (final noun rules)
</h5>
<p>
  Unlike in English, where each noun may independently bear definiteness, in Sindarin only the final noun in a construct chain determines the definiteness of the entire phrase.
</p>
<pre>
  bâr aran    - "a king's house" (indefinite)
  bâr en·aran – "the king's house" (definite)
  bâr erain   - "a house of kings" (plural genitive)
</pre>

<h5>
  Multi-noun construct chains
</h5>
<p>
  Sindarin allows extended construct chains, where multiple nouns are stacked to create complex phrases.
</p>
<pre>
  parf inias ionnath Elros — "[the] book [of] [the] annals [of] [the] sons [of] Elros"
</pre>
<p>
  <small>
    Notice that, because "Elros" is a proper noun, it's considered definite. Because it's the last item in the chain, all other nouns are also definite.
  </small>
</p>
<p>
  Here, the construct has an internal hierarchical structure:
</p>
<pre>
  [parf [inias [ionnath Elros]]]

  ┌─ parf ────────────────────┐
  │ ┌─ inias ───────────────┐ │
  │ │     ionnath Elros     │ │
  │ └───────────────────────┘ │
  └───────────────────────────┘
</pre>

<p>
  Here, the construct sequence spans three levels:
</p>
<pre>
  parf ‹inias ionnath Elros› – the book of ‹the annals of the sons of Elros›
  inias ‹ionnath Elros›      – the annals of ‹the sons of Elros›
  ionnath ‹Elros›            – the sons of ‹Elros›
</pre>
<h6>
  Adjectives in a construct chain
</h6>
<p>
  Such constructions are semantically rich but syntactically rigid. Any adjective modifying the chain must follow the entire construct and agree in number with the element it refers to.
</p>
<p>
  The first element of the chain is the head noun. (In this example, *parf* "the book.") If there is any ambiguity, adjectives by default are interpreted as referring to the head noun. For example:
</p>
<pre>
  brûn = "old"

  **parf** inias ionnath Elros §brûn§**vrûn**§ = "[the] **old** book [of] [the] annals [of] [the] sons [of] Elros"
  
  **brûn** refers to **parf** - the head noun
</pre>
<p>
  However, if syntactic agreement can indicate that the adjective actually refers to another element, that removes the ambiguity:
</p>
<pre>
  beren = "brave" (singular) - plural *berin*

  aglar maethyr en·aran §berin§**verin**§ = "[the] glory [of] [the] **brave** warriors [of] the king"
</pre>
<p>
  Because **berin** is plural, so it could only refer to **maethyr** (warriors), which is also plural.
</p>
<p>
  Semantics can also disambiguate the chain. Example:
</p>
<pre>
  bar en·aran **luin**  = "[the] **blue** house of the king"
  bar en·aran **istui** = "[the] house of the **learned** king"
</pre>
<p>
  If ambiguity persists and the adjective seems to wrongly refer to the head noun, it needs rephrasing.
</p>
<p>
  Multiple adjectives are also possible, and they should show up, after the chain, in reverse order, and agree with their modified nouns:
</p>
<pre>
  bar en·aran **istui** **luin** = "the **blue** house of the **learned** king"
</pre>
<p>
  To illustrate the reverse order of adjectives, let's re-use the first chain example and add adjectives:
</p>
<pre>
  <i>"the <b>great</b> book of the <b>old</b> annals of the <b>valiant</b> sons of <b>noble</b> Elros"</i>

         parf §beleg§**veleg**§  = "**great** book"
       innias **iaur**   = "**old** annals"
      ionnath **thelai** = "**valiant** sons"
        Elros **raud**   = "**noble** Elros"

     parf inias ionnath Elros **raud** **thelai** **iaur** §beleg§**veleg**§

  ┌─ parf ─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │   ┌── inias ───────────────────────────────────┐   │
  │   │   ┌──── ionnath ───────────────────────┐   │   │
  │   │   │             Elros **raud**             │   │   │
  │   │   └─────────────────────── **thelai** ─────┘   │   │
  │   └────────────────────────────────── **iaur** ────┘   │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────── §**veleg**§ ──┘
</pre>
<!--
     parf
     │    inias
     │    │     ionnath
     │    │     │       Elros─**raud**
     │    │     └───────────────── **thelai**
     │    └────────────────────────────── **iaur**
     └──────────────────────────────────────── §**veleg**§
-->
<p>
  While that's possible, it's clear it becomes more and more confusing the more noun-adjective pairs are added, therefore this kind of complex construction should be discouraged.
</p>

<h5>
  Interruption rules (prohibition), ambiguity and stylistic workarounds
</h5>
<p>
  One of the strict features of the construct chain is that it must be uninterrupted. Unlike in English, where modifiers may separate the head noun from its genitive, Sindarin discourages such insertions. An adjective or demonstrative should follow the entire chain. For example:
</p>
<pre>
  Preferred:
  roch aran **maer** = "a good horse of a king" (adjective comes after the whole phrase)

  Highly stylised/poetic:
  roch **maer** aran = "good horse of a king"
</pre>
<p>
  This syntactic rigidity causes ambiguity if the adjective or demonstrative is applicable to multiple nouns. Sindarin normally relies on context or emphasis rather than rearrangement to solve that. A few workarounds may serve as reference:
</p>
<pre>
  maer = "good"

  If the horse is good:

  Standard, but ambiguous:
  roch aran **maer** = "[a] **good** horse [of] [a] king"

  Ungrammatical:
  <s>**maer** roch aran = "[a] **good** horse [of] [a] king"</s>

  Prepositional genitives can prevent ambiguity:
  roch **maer** *nan* aran = "[a] **good** horse *‹of a›* king"

  If the King is good:

  Prepositional genitives:
  roch *nan* aran **maer** = "[a] horse *‹of a›* **good** king"

  Relative pronouns:
  roch aran, i **maer** = "[a] horse [of] [a] king, who [is] **good**"

    According to PE23, "en" is only a definite article. Therefore the old style examples are just juxtapositional genitives with an article that makes it definite.
  </p>
  <pre>
    Haudh-en-Elleth = "Mound [of] the Elf-maid"

    Likewise:

    haudh arwen    "mound [of a] lady"
    haudh en arwen "mound [of] the lady"
    haudh in erwin "mound [of] the ladies"

<h4>
  Prepositional genitives
</h4>

<p>
  Prepositional genitives were very common before <abbr title="Parma Eldalamberon 23">PE23</abbr>'s <abbr title="Common Eldarin Article">CEA</abbr> was introduced in 2024. Among the prepositions were <b>en</b> and <b>in</b>, which are now considered simply definite articles in juxtapositional genitive chains. The last prepositions to be used as a genitive marker are the partitive <b>na(n)</b> preposition and the origin preposition <b>o</b>, both described above.
</p>

<h5>
  Partitive na(n)
</h5>
<p>
  Partitive is when a thing is part of something, e.g. "three of my friends".
</p>
<p>
  The <b>na(n)</b> preposition can mark a genitive as long as the relationship of the nouns matches its description. Tolkien himself described <b>na(n)</b> as such:
</p>
<p>
  <cite>
    na, before vowels nan (nasal mutation), means "with" in sense of possessing, provided with, especially of characteristic feature. Orod na Thôn "Mount of the Pine Tree(s)".
  </cite>
</p>
<p>
  Tolkien contrasted a juxtapositional genitive <i>aran cîr lim</i> (no mutation) with a prepositional genitive <i>aran na chîr lim</i> "king of swift ships". He also compared the genitival preposition na "with, of", causing nasal mutation, with the allative preposition na to, toward", causing soft mutation. So <i>na thaur</i> means "of a forest" while <i>na daur</i> meand "to a forest".
</p>
<p>
  The <b>na(n)</b> preposition should always be indefinite and limited to partitive and compositional relationships. (It can precede an article, however.)
</p>
<p>
  While the sense could be mostly the same, one advantage of using prepositions is that it can break genitive chains and allow more readability, for example, when using adjectives:
</p>
<pre>
  Juxtapositional genitive:
  mellon en·aran **maer** §sael§**hael**§      = "the **wise** friend of the **good** king"
  <small>(lit.) "friend the king good wise"</small>

  Prepositional genitive:
  mellon §sael§**hael**§ **nan** en·aran **maer**  = "the **wise** friend of the **good** king"
  <small>(lit.) "friend wise of the king good"</small>
</pre>

<h4>
  Genitive chains, prepositions, and zero copula
</h4>
<p>
  When using prepositions to form complex sentences, genitive chains may force the prepositions into an indefinite state because the chain itself holds definiteness. For example, the sentence:
</p>
<pre>
  "made by the friends of the elves"
</pre>
<p>
  Would be formed like this:
</p>
<pre>
  carnen §mo§vo§ §mellyn§vellyn§ in·edhil
</pre>
<p>
  Note how there is no article between *mo* and *mellyn*. That's because *mellyn in·edhil* functions as a single structure: *in·edhil* is definite, so the whole chain is definite. This means it doesn't require an article.
</p>
<p>
  Adding an article to the sentence triggers the zero copula (which doesn't make sense):
</p>
<pre>
  <s>carnen §moen§voen§ mellyn in·edhil = "made ‹by the› friends [are] the elves"</s>
</pre>
<p>
  Another example:
</p>
<pre>
  Faramir §ho§cho§ aran Gondor = "Faramir [is] before [the] king [of] Gondor"
</pre>
<p>
  *Gondor* is definite, and so is *aran*.
