  2.2 Adjectives
</h3>
<p>
  Adjectives generally appear after the nouns they modify. Then they undergo <span class="soft">soft mutation</span>.
</p>
<p>
  Adjectives are inflected into the plural the same way that nouns do. They need to agree with their noun.
</p>
<p>
  Neo-Sindarin should distinguish functions via word order. Positioning a predicative adjective before a (definite) noun to avoid ambiguity is permissible but not standard in normal colloquial speech.
</p>
<pre>
  Edhel <span class="soft"><b>dond</b></span>      = a <b>tall</b> Elf
  <b>tond</b> Edhel      = a <b>tall</b> Elf <small>(permissible but not standard)</small>
  en·Edhel <span class="soft"><b>dond</b></span>   = the <b>tall</b> Elf
  e·<span class="soft"><b>dond</b></span> Edhel    = the <b>tall</b> Elf <small>(not standard)</small>
  <b>tond</b> en·Edhel   = the Elf is <b>tall</b>
</pre>
<!--
<p>
  For "an Elf is tall" (predicative + indefinite), I'd use "some" as a quantifier.
</p>
<p>
  For a generic statement "Elves are tall", I'm not sure. Either we accept an inevitable ambiguity, or perhaps we can disambiguate this by adding a pronoun (Edhil ti dynd = "Elves, they are tall").
</p>
 -->
<p>
  Predicative statements such as "an elf is tall" and "elves are tall" are ambiguous with attributive sentences.
</p>
<pre>
  Edhel <span class="soft"><b>dond</b></span>      = "[an] elf [is] tall" or "[a] tall elf"
  Edhil <span class="soft"><b>dynd</b></span>      = "elves [are] tall"   or "tall elves"
</pre>
<p>
  The only way we can disambiguate is by reversing the position, so the copula is implied, as such:
</p>
<pre>
  <b>Tond</b> edhel      = "tall [is] [an] elf"
  <b>Tynd</b> edhil      = "tall [are] elves"
</pre>
<!--
<p>
  The same is used for definite nouns:
</p>
<pre>
  in·edain <b>delin</b>  = "the men (are) <b>hidden</b>"
  in·edain <span class="soft"><b>dhelin</b></span> = "the <b>hidden</b> men"
</pre>
