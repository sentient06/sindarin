  2.2 Adjectives
</h3>
<p>
  Adjectives generally appear after the nouns they modify. Then they undergo §soft mutation§.
</p>
<p>
  Adjectives are inflected into the plural the same way that nouns do. They need to agree with their noun.
</p>
<p>
  Neo-Sindarin should distinguish functions via word order. Positioning a predicative adjective before a (definite) noun to avoid ambiguity is permissible but not standard in normal colloquial speech.
</p>
<pre>
  edhel §**dond**§      = a **tall** elf
  **tond** edhel      = a **tall** elf <small>(permissible but not standard)</small>
  en·edhel §**dond**§   = the **tall** elf
  e·§**dond**§ edhel    = the **tall** elf <small>(not standard)</small>
  **tond** en·edhel   = the elf is **tall**
</pre>
<!--
<p>
  For "an Elf is tall" (predicative + indefinite), I'd use "some" as a quantifier.
</p>
<p>
  For a generic statement "Elves are tall", I'm not sure. Either we accept an inevitable ambiguity, or perhaps we can disambiguate this by adding a pronoun (Edhil ti dynd = "Elves, they are tall").
</p>
 -->
<p>
  Predicative statements such as "an elf is tall" and "elves are tall" are ambiguous with attributive sentences.
</p>
<pre>
  edhel §**dond**§      = "[an] elf [is] tall" or "[a] tall elf"
  edhil §**dynd**§      = "elves [are] tall"   or "tall elves"
</pre>
<p>
  The only way we can disambiguate is by reversing the position, so the copula is implied, as such:
</p>
<pre>
  **tond** edhel      = "tall [is] [an] elf"
  **tynd** edhil      = "tall [are] elves"
</pre>

<h4>
  Multiple adjectives
</h4>
<p>
  When a noun is described by multiple adjectives, there is no consensus on whether they should mutate.
</p>
<p>
  My opinion and recommendation is that no, the mutation the adjective goes through is purely phonological and thus only the **first** adjective should be mutated. That aligns somewhat with Welsh, which mutates the first adjective.
</p>
<p>
  I also think that there is no particular order for adjectives, and they should not end with an "and" word.
</p>
<p>
  For example, "a slow big black horse" would be any of the following:
</p>
<pre>
  roch **§borg§vorg§ guir morn** = "[a] horse **big slow black**"
  roch **§guir§'uir§ borg morn** = "[a] horse **slow big black**"
  roch **§morn§vorn§ guir borg** = "[a] horse **black slow big**"
  *etc.*
</pre>
