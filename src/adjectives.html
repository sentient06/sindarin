  2.2 Adjectives
</h3>
<p>
  Adjectives generally appear after the nouns they modify. Then they undergo §s{soft mutation}.
</p>
<p>
  Adjectives are inflected into the plural the same way that nouns do. They need to agree with their noun.
</p>
<p>
  Neo-Sindarin should distinguish functions via word order. Positioning a predicative adjective before a (definite) noun to avoid ambiguity is permissible but not standard in normal colloquial speech.
</p>
<pre>
  edhel **§s{dond}**      = "a **tall** elf"
  **tond** edhel      = "**tall** [is] [an] elf" ±(permissible but not standard)±
  en·edhel **§s{dond}**   = "the elf [is] **tall**" or ~ "the **tall** elf"
  **tond** en·edhel   = "**tall** [is] the elf"
  
  <s>e·**§s{dond}** edhel</s>    = "the **tall** [is] elf" ±(ungrammatical, avoid)±
</pre>
<!--
<p>
  For "an Elf is tall" (predicative + indefinite), I'd use "some" as a quantifier.
</p>
<p>
  For a generic statement "Elves are tall", I'm not sure. Either we accept an inevitable ambiguity, or perhaps we can disambiguate this by adding a pronoun (Edhil ti dynd = "Elves, they are tall").
</p>
 -->
<p>
  Predicative statements such as "an elf is tall" and "elves are tall" are ambiguous with attributive sentences.
</p>
<pre>
  edhel **§s{dond}**      = "[an] elf [is] tall" or "[a] tall elf"
  edhil **§s{dynd}**      = "elves [are] tall"   or "tall elves"
</pre>
<p>
  The only way we can disambiguate is by reversing the position, so the copula is implied, as such:
</p>
<pre>
  **tond** edhel      = "tall [is] [an] elf"
  **tynd** edhil      = "tall [are] elves"
</pre>

<h4>
  Multiple adjectives
</h4>
<p>
  When a noun is described by multiple adjectives, there is no consensus on whether they should mutate.
</p>
<p>
  The hypothesis I subscribe to and recommend is that<br>
  No, the mutation the adjective goes through is purely phonological and thus only the **first** adjective should be mutated. That aligns somewhat with Welsh, which mutates the first adjective.
</p>
<p>
  This structure also works well when using multiple adjectives with a genitive chain. To look into that case, please head to the ||#genitive||genitive section|| below.
</p>
<p>
  English has a conventional (though not strict) adjective order. It's usually something like: adjectives of opinion, size, age, shape, etc.
</p>
<p>
  Romance and Celtic languages lack a memorised stacking template like English, but they typically order adjectives according to semantic scope. I suggest using the same structure in Sindarin:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    inherent / classifying properties closest to the noun
  </li>
  <li>
    physical/descriptive properties next
  </li>
  <li>
    evaluative/subjective properties further out
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Use pre-nominal position mainly for emphasis, evaluation, or lexicalised meanings.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, don't end a list of adjectives with the word "and" between the last two items. (That's the same for any lists in Sindarin.)
</p>
<p>
  For example, "a beautiful proud black horse":
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    beautiful: evaluative
  </li>
  <li>
    proud: descriptive/character
  </li>
  <li>
    black: inherent/classifying
  </li>
</ul>
<pre>
  roch **§s{vorn|morn} tarlang bain**  = "[a] horse **black proud beautiful**" ±(lit.)±
</pre>
<p>
  If different adjectives concern the same semantic group, the order doesn't matter:
</p>
<pre>
  roch **§s{vorg|borg} guir morn** = "[a] horse **big slow black**"
  roch **§s{'uir|guir} borg morn** = "[a] horse **slow big black**"
  roch **§s{vorn|morn} guir borg** = "[a] horse **black slow big**"
</pre>
