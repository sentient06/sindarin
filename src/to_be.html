<h4>
  Copular system
</h4>
<p>
  The verb **na-**, "to be", exists in published texts only as imperative **no** (and some sketchy notes.)
</p>
<p>
  A proper conjugation can be reconstructed based on evidence, but all reconstructions are entirely hypothetical.
</p>
<p>
  The "to be" is implied most of the time by the sequence of words, via the **copular system**.
</p>
<p>
  A copula is often a verb or a verb-like word, though this is not universally the case.
</p>
<p>
  Most languages have one main copula (in English, the verb "to be"), although some (such as Spanish, Portuguese and Thai) have more than one, while others have none.
</p>
<p>
  In English, in "to be" statements as in "you are wise", "Elrond is an elf", the verb connecting the subject (you, Elrond) to its predicate (wise, an Elf) is the copula.
</p>
<p>
  Sindarin does not use an evident copula word in such sentences: the subject and predicate are simply placed next to each other with no joining word. In linguistics this is referred to as a **zero copula**.
</p>
<p>
  Neo-Sindarin writers use an independent pronoun together with its predicate for "to be" statements:
</p>
<pre>
  me edhil   = "we [are] elves"
  le §s{hael|sael}    = "you [are] wise"
  ti §s{velig|belig}   = "they [are] mighty"
  te §s{vaethor|maethor} = "he [is] [a] warrior"
</pre>
<p>
  In this system, the predicate noun or adjective matches the subject in number.
</p>
<p>
  Many Sindarin writers agree that a predicate adjective is not mutated (see <a href="#mutations" class="inner-anchor">mutations</a> below.) However, there is no evidence that this would be the case. This is a common convention, but by no means universal.
</p>
<p>
  For past and future copulas, the suggestion is to use **nî** and **tho** (or **natho**):
</p>
<pre>
  Elrond **nî** sí    = "Elrond **was** there"
  Elrond **tho** sí   = "Elrond **will be** here" ±or...±
  Elrond **natho** sí = "Elrond **will be** here"
</pre>

    More about the zero copula

    The zero copula introduces some interesting challenges in Sindarin. For more details about these and their solutions and examples, take a look at the page below:

<h4>
  Existential verb
</h4>
<p>
  There is a mysterious verb **da-** that should be used for existential statements.
</p>
<p>
  There are two different theories of what **da-** really is. But despite uncertainty about its etymology, there is practical agreement.
</p>
<details>
  <summary>The origin of **da-**</summary>
  <p>
    The construction using that word appears in a single phrase from Tolkien's 1969 Late Notes on Verb Structure that seems to be a verb for existential statements:
  </p>
<pre>
  inn đa v'im = "I have a good mind (to do so)"
  (lit.) "a mind there is in me"
</pre>
  <p>
    This phrase was originally written as <i>inn no v'im</i>, with **no** changed to **đa**.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>
      Theory 1: Eroded form of na- "to be"
    </b>
  </p>
  <p>
    The original alteration from **no** to **đa** suggests heavy erosion/mutation of the copula **na-**. However, this faces a significant problem: Tolkien's same 1969 notes explicitly distinguish existential "exist" (<code>√EÑE</code>) from copular "be" (<code>√NA</code>), stating **NA** was not used for existential statements in Quenya.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>
      Theory 2: Distinct existential verb from root *√DA
    </b>
  </p>
  <p>
    **đa** may represent a separate Sindarin existential verb **da-** (equivalent to Quenya <code>√EÑ</code>), distinct from the copula. This aligns better with Tolkien's theoretical framework separating existential from copular uses.
  </p>
</details>
<p>
  **da-** is Sindarin's only attested means of making existential statements ("there is/exists").
</p>
<p>
  Its semantics should be limited to the attested construction: "*there is X*" and "*there is X in/at/on/under/etc Y*".
</p>
<p>
  It functions as an existential verb, not a copula, and cannot take direct objects.
</p>
<p>
  Some scholars were cautious about recommending it for Neo-Sindarin due to its speculative nature, yet <abbr title="Parma Eldalamberon 23">PE23</abbr> made its status significantly more certain.
</p>
<p>
  There is no attested past tense formation, although a few have been proposed: **daun** for singular, and possibly **doner**/**dóner** for plural.
</p>
<p>
  We also don't know its plural inflection behaviour, nor whether it functions as a regular verb. It almost certainly functions as a clitic (uninflected.)
</p>
<p>
  A proposed negative equivalent la (&lt; LĀ) remains experimental.
</p>
<p>
  Examples:
</p>
<pre>
  Singular:
  rach **§s{dha|da}** §s{vi|mi} §n{ñelaidh|gelaidh}        = "danger **is** ‹in the› trees"
  roch §s{vorg|borg} **da** §s{vi|mi} §n{ñelaidh|gelaidh}    = "a big horse **is** ‹in the› trees"

  Plural:
  lyth §s{dhail|dail} **dar** §s{vin|min} §s{hant|sant}    = "**there are** delicate flowers ‹in the› garden"
  rych **§s{dhar|dar}** §s{vin|min} §n{ñelaidh|gelaidh}      = "horses **are** ‹in the› trees"

  Past singular:
  rach **§s{dhaun|daun}** §s{vi|mi} §n{ñelaidh|gelaidh}      = "danger **was** ‹in the› trees"
  lyth §s{dhail|dail} **daun** §s{vin|min} §s{hant|sant}   = "**there were** delicate flowers ‹in the› garden"

  Past plural:
  lyth §s{dhail|dail} **dóner** §s{vin|min} §s{hant|sant}  = "**there were** delicate flowers ‹in the› garden"
  rych §s{vyrg|byrg} **doner** §s{vi|mi} §n{ñelaidh|gelaidh} = "big horses **were** ‹in the› trees"
</pre>
<!-- beriannen vo ni io dha gaeth o theinas -->
<!-- ‹I protected› ‹by (agent of), with› ‹me› ‹when› ‹exist› reason from law -->
<!-- Protected by me when there is reason from law. -->

<!-- The scholarly community treats this verb with appropriate caution given the single attestation, but recognises its importance as the only known Sindarin existential construction. -->

<h4>
  Guidelines
</h4>
<p>
  The following guidelines may help elucidate how the copula is used:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <span>The verb **na-** is ommitted in "to be" phrases:</span>
    <pre>
  Elrond ⏝ edhel = "Elrond [is] [an] elf"
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>Some people think it's best if predicate adjectives are not mutated, and some reverse the position of the adjectives:</span>
    <pre>
  <s>en·edhel **bain** = "the elf [is] **beautiful**"</s> ±(avoid)±
  **bain** en·edhel = "**beautiful** [is] the elf" ±(prefer)±
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>The predicate matches the subject in number:</span>
    <pre>
  in·edain **§s{velig|belig}** = "the men [are] **mighty**" ±(ambiguous with "the mighty men")±
  **belig** in·edain = "**mighty** [are] the men"
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    "To be" phrases use independent pronouns as subjects:
    <pre>
  **me** edhil = "**we** [are] elves"
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Use past and future copulas **nî** and **tho** for "was" and "will be":
    <pre>
  Elrond **nî** ennas = "Elrond **was** there"
  Elrond **tho** sí   = "Elrond **will be** here" ±or...±
  Elrond **natho** sí = "Elrond **will be** here"
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    These past and future copulas are inflected with pronominal suffixes as appropriate:
    <pre>
  **nîn** ennas = "**I was** there"
  **thof** sí   = "**we will be** here" ±Questionable±
  **nathof** sí = "**we will be** here" ±(alternate future copula)±
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Use **da-** for existential statements, and inflect for number:
    <pre>
  lyth §s{dhail|dail} **dóner** §s{vin|min} §s{hant|sant} = "**there were** delicate flowers ‹in the› garden"
    </pre>
  </li>
</ul>
