<h2>
  %section% Modal constructions
</h2>
<p>
  In English, modal verbs are auxiliary verbs that express possibility, ability, obligation, permission, or likelihood. The core set in modern English is: can, could, may, might, shall, should, will, would and must.
</p>
<p>
  Sindarin has no direct equivalents to these English verbs. There are no one-word translations most of the time, and many constructions for modal equivalents don't even use verbs.
</p>
<p>
  Instead, different strategies are used to translate from English into equivalents in Sindarin.
</p>

<h3>
  Ability and possibility
</h3>
<p>
  Sindarin has two verbs that can translate to English <b>can</b>:
</p>
<p>
  <b>pol-</b> means to be physically able to do something, to have the capacity of executing an action.
</p>
<p>
  <b>ista-</b> means to have the knowledge to do something, understanding it, having the skill.
</p>
<div class="wrapper">
<div class="a1">
  <a href="https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-3018804647.html" target="_blank">pol-</a> = "to can, to be (physically) able to"
  Use this verb for physical capacity.
  Use verbal noun.
</div>
<div class="a2">
  <b>pelin</b> peded = "<b>‹I can›</b> speak"
  (because I am physically unhindered)
</div>
<div class="a1">
  <a href="https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-4226423969.html" target="_blank">ista-</a> = "to have knowledge"
  Use for mental capacity
  Use verbal noun
</div>
<div class="a2">
  <b>istan</b> peded = "<b>‹I can›</b> speak"
  (because I know how to)
</div>
</div>

<h3>
  Advice & possibility
</h3>
<p>
  There is no distinction between could and should in Sindarin. There is an adverb that can point to a possibility: <b>aen</b>, used in the King's Letter.
</p>
<p>
  This adverb uses the future tense.
</p>
<div class="wrapper">
<div class="a1">
  <a href="https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1414245343.html" target="_blank">aen</a> = "should" or "could"
  Adverb
  Uses future tense
</div>
<div class="a2">
  i Panthael estathar <b>aen</b> = "who <b>should</b> be called Fullwise"
  "who Fullwise ‹be called› <b>should</b>" (lit.)
</div>
</div>


<h3>
  Possibility & permission
</h3>
<p>
  Again, an adverb can probably fill in. <b>ce</b> should work the same way as <b>aen</b>, using the future tense.
</p>
<div class="wrapper">
<div class="a1">
  <a href="https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-309907085.html" target="_blank">ce</a> = "may(be), might"
  Adverb
  Undocumented for this function, recommend using future tense
</div>
<div class="a2">
  i Panthael estathar <b>ce</b> = "who <b>may</b> be called Fullwise"
  "who Fullwise ‹be called› <b>may</b>" (lit.)
</div>
</div>

<h3>
  Likelihood and intention
</h3>
<p>
  In English, the verb "will" is used as auxiliary to denote periphrastic future tense. The verb "shall" often plays the same role.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, in a more classic English, "will" and "shall" had different meanings. "Will" denoting desire and "shall" denoting obligation. "I will" would mean something close to "I want to" and "I shall" something akin to "I have to".
</p>
<p>
  In Sindarin, there is a real, morphological future tense. And there is a verb for "to will", <b>nidh-</b>. There is nothing strictly equivalent to "shall", but the declaring of the intention to do something can be expressed with this verb by using a verbal noun with it. This verb should not, however, be used for periphrastic future tense. Its meaning should be limited to intention as it would in Middle English.
</p>
<p>
  (Remembering that "would" is the past tense of "will".)
</p>
<div class="wrapper">
<div class="a1">
  <a href="https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-524470103.html" target="_blank">nidh-</a> = "to will, mean to, intend"
  Uses verbal noun
</div>
<div class="a2">
  menathon     = "‹I will go›" → No need to express desire
  <b>nidhin</b> mened = "<b>‹I will›</b> go" = "<b>‹I will›</b> ‹to go›" (lit.)
                               ≈ "<b>‹I have a mind›</b> to go"
                               ≈ "<b>‹I intend›</b> to go"
  <!-- nathof hí = "‹we will be› here" -->
  <b>enídhen</b> mened = "<b>‹I would›</b> go"
                ≈ "<b>‹I would intend›</b> to go"
</div>
</div>

<h3>
  Obligation
</h3>
<p>
  There is an impersonal verb that describes a need for something to happen, which is the best translation for "must": <b>boe</b>. It uses verbal noun and if it needs a pronoun, use a generic "it" or "they". The agent who is object of the need becomes an object of the verb. Use dative pronouns.
</p>
<p>
  <b>boe</b> is probably defective and can't be conjugated. It's assumed to be always in the third person. We don't know whether it should inflect for plural, probably not.

<div class="a1">
  <a href="https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1519369531.html" target="_blank">boe [mb-]</a> = "must (impersonal), (lit.) *[it] needs"
  Uses dative and verbal noun
</div>
<div class="a2">
  <b>boe</b> annin maded = "I <b>must</b> eat"
  "<b>‹it needs›</b> ‹for me› ‹to eat›" (lit.)
