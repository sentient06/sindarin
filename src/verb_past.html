<p>
  Past tense in Sindarin is highly irregular, because it can derive from Common Eldarin and other morphological changes depending on the verb.
</p>

<h4>
  Basic verbs
</h4>
<p>
  Basic verbs form their past in two main ways, depending on the verb:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Via vocalic augment + vowel mutation; or</li>
  <li>Nasal-infixion</li>
</ul>

<h5>
  Past with vocalic augment + vowel mutation
</h5>
<p>
  This is used for many basic verbs (especially those not ending in b/d/g). The basic mechanism is this:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add a <b>vocalic augment</b> (usually a-, sometimes e- depending on the base vowel).</li>
  <li>
    <span>The <b>base vowel is lengthened</b> and undergoes its usual Sindarin change:</span>
    <ul>
      <li>a → o</li>
      <li>e → i</li>
      <li>o → u</li>
      <li>a → aw if the result becomes monosyllabic</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The consonant after the augment soft-mutates.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If the verb has a prefix, the augment may be omitted (e.g. echad- → echant instead of edachant).
</p>
<p>
  If the uninflected past becomes monosyllabic, long ā → au, as in aul “grew” (though this one is technically a strong past of a derived verb).
</p>
<p>
  Examples:
</p>
<pre>
  car-  agor    "did/made"
  dew-  edíw    "failed"
  nor-  onur    "ran"
  sav-  aw      "had"
  bal-  aval    "had power"
  nidh- enidhen "I intended" (inflected)
</pre>

<h5>
  Nasal-infixed pasts
</h5>
<p>
  This is used mainly for basic verbs whose roots originally ended in p, t, k, which become b, d, g in Sindarin. This is the mechanism:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Insert a nasal (n/m) before the final consonant.</li>
  <li>
    <span>Restore the ancient voiceless stop:</span>
    <ul>
      <li>b → mp</li>
      <li>d → nt</li>
      <li>g → nc</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Sometimes there are both nasal and augmented alternatives (e.g., dag- → aðag and aðanc).
</p>
<p>
  Prefixes block augmentation (as above with echad- → echant).
</p>
<p>
  Inflected forms may use joining vowels -e- or -i-, but the evidence is inconsistent (e.g., echannen, echanthel).
</p>
<p>
  Examples:
</p>
<pre>
  echad- echant "made"
  ped-   pent   "said"
  tag-   tanc   "fixed"
  cab-   agamp  "leapt" (implied)
  dag-   aðanc  "slew" (alternating with augmented aðag)
  caw-   cawn   "tasted"
</pre>

<h5>
  Recommendation
</h5>
<p>
  Use nasal infixion if the stem ends in b, d, g (from ancient p, t, k).
</p>
<p>
  E.g. ped-, tag-, echad-, cab-.
</p>
<p>
  Use augment + vowel mutation for most other stems.
</p>
<p>
  E.g. car-, dew-, nor-, nidh-, sav-, bal-.

  Yes (√KAT)
  Then omit the augment   = echant

<h4>
  Derived verbs
</h4>
</div>
<p>
  Derived verbs are more complicated because the past tense varies whether the verb is transitive or intransitive, has a strong past tense or half-strong.
</p>

<h5>
  Strong past tense
</h5>
<p>
  Strong pasts are rare, and only two Sindarin cases are attested: <i>anna-</i> and <i>gala-</i>.
</p>
<p>
  They are irregular, mirroring similar irregularities in Quenya and earlier stages of Elvish.
</p>
<p>
  These verbs form their past tense not with the regular weak suffix <i>-ant</i>, but instead with an old strong past built directly from the verbal root. They both end in <b>-a</b> formed from an old root-based past that is inherited (e.g., ✶ānē → ōn).
</p>
<p>
  No general pattern for these verbs can be provided.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>ōn "gave" violates expected Sindarin sound laws.</li>
  <li>aul "grew" is phonologically regular but treated as a special inherited form.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Besides the two verbs mentioned, we don't know which derived verbs have strong pasts. They are assumed to be irregular exceptions, not a productive pattern.
</p>
<div class="wrapper">
<div class="a1">
  anna- (to give)

  1st person - ónen    - I gave
  2nd person - óneg    - thou gavest

  3rd person - ón      - he/she gave

  2nd person - ónegir  - you gave
  2nd person - ónedhir - you gave
  3rd person - óner    - they gave
</div>

<div class="a2">

  2nd person - ólegir  - you grew
  2nd person - óledhir - you grew
  3rd person - óler    - they grew
</div>

</div>

<h5>
  Transitive Verbs
</h5>
<p>
  Derived transitive verbs form their regular ("weak") past tense with the suffix <i>-ant</i>. This is the default and normal past-tense formation for this verb class.
</p>
<p>
  It likely originated from half-strong causatives, but functionally it is simply the normal past ending.
</p>
<p>
  If a derived verb takes a direct object → use -ant.
</p>
<p>
  Some -ant forms show a vocalic augment (a-, e-, o-), but this is not required and is not shown in most examples. Example:
</p>
<pre>
  carfa- "speak" → agarfant (augmented)
  
  but also expected:

  carfant (unaugmented — Tolkien deleted this form, but it shows the base pattern)
</pre>
<p>
  To form the past of a derived transitive verb:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Take the verb stem (teitha-, r[a]itha-, carfa-, etc.)</li>
  <li>
    <span>Add the suffix <b>-ant</b></span><br />
    <span>Optionally:</span>
    <ul>
      <li>add a vocalic augment (a-, e-, o-) before the stem (rare, not required)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>For pronoun endings:</span><br />
    <span>insert -e- before the pronoun</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>Optionally:</span>
    <span>Add medial development</span>
  </li>
</ul>
<pre>
  Verb: <b>tiria-</b> (to watch)

  Add the suffix          = tiria-    → tiri<b>ant</b>
  Inflecting for person
  Join with -e-           = tiriant   → tiriant<b>e</b>l
  Add medial development  = tiria<b>nt</b>el → tiria<b>nn</b>el

  Verb: <b>carfa-</b> (to speak)

  Add the suffix          = carfa-   → carf<b>ant</b>
  Add a vocalic augment   = carfant  → <b>a</b>carfant
  And mutate consonant    = acarfant → a<b>g</b>arfant
</pre>

<h5>
  Intransitive Verbs
</h5>
<p>
  Derived intransitive verbs form their regular past tense with the suffix <i>-as</i>.
</p>
<p>
  A verb can take <i>-as</i> when it is used intransitively, even if it otherwise forms <i>-ant</i> when transitive. Thus, the classification depends on use, not the inherent nature of the verb.
</p>
<p>
  To form intransitive past, the mechanism is:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Take the verb stem (e.g., rhitha-, egledhia-, ista-)</li>
  <li>
    <span>Add the suffix <b>-as</b> (optional spelling variation: -ast)</span><br />
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>For pronoun endings:</span><br />
    <span>insert -e- before the pronoun</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>Optionally:</span>
    <span>Add medial development</span>
  </li>
</ul>
<pre>
  Verb: <b>tiria-</b> (to watch)

  Add the suffix          = tiria-   → tiri<b>as</b>
  Inflecting for person
  Join with -e-           = tirias   → tirias<b>e</b>l
  Add medial development  = tiria<b>s</b>el → tiria<b>ss</b>el

  Verb: <b>muda-</b> (to toil)

  Add the suffix          = muda-    → mud<b>as</b>
  Inflecting for person
  Join with -e-           = mudas    → mudas<b>e</b>l
  Add medial development  = muda<b>s</b>el  → muda<b>ss</b>el
</pre>
<p>
  There is a single example with an augment, which could, perhaps, be treated as irregular, for practical purposes:
</p>
<pre>
  Verb: <b>carfa-</b> (to speak)

  Add the suffix          = carfa-    → carf<b>as</b>
  Add a vocalic augment   = carfas    → <b>a</b>carfas
  And mutate consonant    = acarfas   → a<b>g</b>arfas
  Inflecting for person
  Join with -e-           = agarfas   → agarfas<b>e</b>l
  Add medial development  = agarfa<b>s</b>el → agarfa<b>ss</b>el
</pre>

<h5>
  Half-strong pasts
</h5>
</div>
<p>
  There is a mysterious category of half-strong past verbs that use the suffix <b>-d(a)</b> in their present stem (because they come from ancient <b>-tā</b> causatives), and form their past tense with nasal infixion (<b>-nt</b>).
</p>
<p>
  These are the origin of the common transitive past suffix <b>-ant</b>, but half-strong verbs themselves don't use <b>-ant</b> — they use <b>-nt</b> directly. There is only one verb of this category attested in Sindarin, and 3 others attested in Noldorin.
</p>
<p>
  The verbs are these:
</p>
<pre>
  <b>covad(a)-</b> = "make meet" → past <b>covant</b>   "[made] met"
  <b>lhimmid</b>   = "moisten"   → past <b>lhimmint</b> "moistened, made moist"
  <b>nimmid</b>    = "whiten"    → past <b>nimmint</b>  "whitened, made white"

  and:
  <b>eria-</b>     = "rise"      → archaic half-strong past †<b>oronte</b> "arose"

  But <b>eria-</b> later became a regular intransitive past <b>erias</b>.
