  %section% Future tense
</h2>
<p>
  There are two patterns for future tense: one for basic verbs and one for derived verbs. And they behave almost identically.
</p>
<h3>
  Basic verbs
</h3>
<p>
  If the verb ends on a consonant, simply use the stem with the suffix <b>-atha</b>. Then add the pronoun endings.
</p>
<p>
  When you add pronominal endings, the final "a" mutates into "o", just like in other verb inflections, except on the third person. Example:
</p>
<pre>
  car- (to do)

  1st person - carathon  - I will do
  2nd person - carathog  - thou wilt do
  2nd person - carathol  - thou wilt do
  2nd person - carathodh - thou wilt do
  3rd person - caratha   - he/she will do

  1st person - carathof  - we will do
  2nd person - carathodh - you will do
  3rd person - carathar  - they will do
</pre>

<h3>
  Derived verbs
</h3>
<p>
  If the verb ends on "a", simply add the suffix <b>-tha</b>. Then add the pronoun endings.
</p>
<p>
  Likewise, the final "a" mutates into "o" except on third person. Example:
</p>
<pre>
  linna- (to sing)

  1st person - linnathon  - I will do
  2nd person - linnathog  - thou wilt do
  2nd person - linnathol  - thou wilt do
  2nd person - linnathodh - thou wilt do
  3rd person - linnatha   - he/she will do

  1st person - linnathof  - we will do
  2nd person - linnathodh - you will do
  3rd person - linnathar  - they will do
</pre>
