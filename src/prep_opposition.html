  (lo is a conjunction, see below)


   The definite forms I'm using are mostly derived
   with ✶i in singular, causing soft mutation,
   and ✶im in plural, causing nasal mutation

   However, prepositions where suffixing ✶i would result in the same form as the indefinite form
   will derive their definite forms with ✶inā in sg. and ✶im in plural,

   resulting in the same form but different mutations -

   mixed (as per PE23/141) in sg. and nasal in pl.


The forms I am using:

mutations are soft  in singular and nasal in plural, if two forms are listed (respectively)
              mixed in singular and nasal in plural, if one form is listed


an (dative) > (e)ni, (e)nin;
be (I assume < ✶bai) > ben,
di "beneath, under" > din
fo "before (temporal)" (< ✶pʰā) > foe, foen;
gu "(together) with)" (< ✶wō) > gui, guin;
ho "before (spatial)" (< ✶kʰʲā) > hoe, hoen;
mi "in" > min;
mo (instrumental, < ✶mā) > moe, moen;
nu "under" > nui, nuin;
o "from" (< ✶ho, not✶aut) > ui, uin;
po "on" (< ✶pā) > poe, poen;

Note that for na (allative) and sa "beside" I elide the vowel before another vowel as well as before articles,
so n' en- etc.


  I am also treating nia as an abandoned concept, so nan will have no special definite form.
