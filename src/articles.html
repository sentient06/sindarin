  Sindarin has no indefinite article like English "a, an"; the absence of a definite article indicates that the noun is indefinite:
</p>
<pre>
  Edhel = "Elf" or "an Elf"
</pre>
<p>
  The definite article recommended is the one from the <i>Common Eldarin Article (<abbr title="Common Eldarin Article">CEA</abbr>)</i>, from 1969, first published in 2024 on <abbr title="Parma Eldalamberon 23">PE23</abbr>/135.
</p>
<p>
  In notes on the <abbr title="Common Eldarin Article">CEA</abbr>, Tolkien decided that the singular article was (mostly) **e** rather than **i**, taking the form **en** before vowels.
</p>
<p>
  In <abbr title="Common Eldarin Article">CEA</abbr>, the singular definite article was derived from an ancient emphatic article ✶inā, with a-affection resulting in e(n).
</p>
<p>
  The singular form *e(n)* induces §s{soft mutation} on a following consonant, while the plural *i(n)* induces §n{nasal mutation}.
</p>
<p>
  When preceding **r-**, the §n{nasal} **-n** becomes **-dh**.
</p>
<p>
  When preceding **gw-**, the plural article retains the **-n**. (Unless it's an ancient **ngw-** word.)
</p>
<pre>
  Noun starting on a vowel:
  **en**  for singular
  **in**  for plural

  Noun starting on a consonant:
  **e**   + §s{soft mutation} for singular
  **i**   + §n{nasal mutation} for plural
  **i§n{dh}** + **r-** for plural nouns starting in **r-**
  **in**  + **w-** for plural nouns starting in **gw-**
</pre>
<!-- im   + br -->
<!-- Thus perhaps *im brennyn “the lords (brannon-plural)” assuming the cluster br resists mutation. There is, however, a counterexample to assimilation from CEA: parth “field” → in·pherth (PE23/139); see below for more on the system in CEA.  -->
<p>
  It's a Neo-Sindarin convention to use a dash (-) or a dot (·) after the definite article. This started with Tolkien sometimes (but not always) doing it as a marker of its <abbr title="A monosyllabic word having no stress or accent and pronounced as a prefix of the following word">proclitic</abbr> nature.
</p>
<p>
  Examples:
</p>
<pre>
  **e**·§s{cherdir} = "the master"  (herdir)
  **en**·arben  = "the knight"
  **i**·§n{thiw}    = "the signs"   (tiw &lt; têw)
  **in**·emyn   = "the hills"   (emyn &lt; amon)
  **i§n{dh}**·Rodyn = "the Valar"
  **i**·§n{ñgwaidh} = "the shadows"
  **in**·§n{wind}   = "the maidens"
