  Sindarin has no indefinite article like English "a, an"; the absence of a definite article indicates that the noun is indefinite:
</p>
<pre>
  Edhel = "Elf" or "an Elf"
</pre>
<p>
  The definite article recommended is the one from the <i>Common Eldarin Article (CEA)</i>, from 1969, first published in 2024 on PE23/135.
</p>
<p>
  In notes on the CEA, Tolkien decided that the singular article was (mostly) <b>e</b> rather than <b>i</b>, taking the form <b>en</b> before vowels.
</p>
<p>
  In CEA, the singular definite article was derived from an ancient emphatic article ✶inā, with a-affection resulting in e(n).
</p>
<p>
  The singular form induces <span class="soft">soft mutation</span> on a following consonant, while the plural induces <span class="nasal">nasal mutation</span>.
</p>
<pre>
  e(n) + <span class="soft">soft mutation</span> for singular
  i(n) + <span class="nasal">nasal mutation</span> for plural
</pre>
<p>
  It's a Neo-Sindarin convention to use a dash (-) or a dot (·) after the definite article. This started with Tolkien sometimes (but not always) doing it as a marker of its <abbr title="A monosyllabic word having no stress or accent and pronounced as a prefix of the following word">proclitic</abbr> nature.
</p>
<p>
  Examples:
</p>
<pre>
  <b>E</b>·<span class="soft">cherdir</span> = "the master"       (herdir)
  <b>En</b>·arben  = "the knight"
  <b>I</b>·<span class="nasal">thiw</span>    = "the signs/letter" (tiw < têw)
  <b>In</b>·<span class="nasal">emyn</span>   = "the hills"       (emyn < amon)
</pre>
