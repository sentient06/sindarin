  Sindarin has no indefinite article like English "a, an"; the absence of a definite article indicates that the noun is indefinite:
</p>
<pre>
  Edhel = "Elf" or "an Elf"
</pre>
<p>
  The definite article recommended is the one from the <i>Common Eldarin Article (<abbr title="Common Eldarin Article">CEA</abbr>)</i>, from 1969, first published in 2024 on <abbr title="Parma Eldalamberon 23">PE23</abbr>/135.
</p>
<p>
  In notes on the <abbr title="Common Eldarin Article">CEA</abbr>, Tolkien decided that the singular article was (mostly) **e** rather than **i**, taking the form **en** before vowels.
</p>
<p>
  In <abbr title="Common Eldarin Article">CEA</abbr>, the singular definite article was derived from an ancient emphatic article ✶inā, with a-affection resulting in e(n).
</p>
<p>
  The singular form induces §soft mutation§ on a following consonant, while the plural induces §§nasal mutation§§.
</p>
<p>
  When preceding **r-**, the §§nasal§§ **-n** becomes **-dh**.
</p>
<pre>
  e(n) + §soft mutation§ for singular
  i(n) + §§nasal mutation§§ for plural
  i§§dh§§  + **r-** for plural nouns starting in **r-**
</pre>
<p>
  It's a Neo-Sindarin convention to use a dash (-) or a dot (·) after the definite article. This started with Tolkien sometimes (but not always) doing it as a marker of its <abbr title="A monosyllabic word having no stress or accent and pronounced as a prefix of the following word">proclitic</abbr> nature.
</p>
<p>
  Examples:
</p>
<pre>
  **e**·§cherdir§ = "the master"       (herdir)
  **en**·arben  = "the knight"
  **i**·§§thiw§§    = "the signs/letter" (tiw &lt; têw)
  **in**·emyn   = "the hills"       (emyn &lt; amon)
  **i§§dh§§**·Rodyn = "the Valar"
  **i**·§§ñgwaidh§§  = "the shadows"
</pre>
