    General background on Sindarin
  </h2>
  <p>
    There is a lot of information already available on the history and development of Sindarin, which will not be repeated on this page.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you wish to know about its history, I suggest reading this page from Ardalambion first:<br>
    [Sindarin - the Noble Tongue](https://ardalambion.net/sindarin.htm)
  </p>
  <p>
    For a grounded check on how Elvish languages were developed by Tolkien, I suggest this page from Eldamo:<br>
    [Conceptual History of Elvish](https://eldamo.org/general/conceptual-history.html)
  </p>
  <p>
    It might be worth mentioning that the writings of Professor Tolkien [are not published in their entirety](https://old.reddit.com/r/tolkienfans/comments/klp7rb/the_unpublished_writing_of_jrr_tolkien/).
  </p>
  <p>
    This is why there are mentions of "latest paradigms" and "changes" in Sindarin's grammar and constructions. We had new information about Sindarin as recently as 2024, and more material will potentially come to light in the next years.
  </p>
  <p>
    Having that in mind, please notice that the information on sources such as Ardalambion and Eldamo and books like David Salo's may differ, because they were written at different times, when different information was available. As far as I understand, Eldamo is the most up-to-date source of Elvish grammar at the moment (even though it focuses on Quenya.)

    Notes on conventions used
  </h2>
  <p>
    Before starting, you might notice that some words are highlighted like §s{this} or §n{this}. This represents mutated words. Don't worry about it until you get to the mutations section. <span class="dont-print">(If you forgot how some mutation works, try hovering the cursor over the mutated word.)</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    When an example is meant to highlight something, the keywords will be **bold**. If there are two concepts together, *italic* might also be used. (This is not 100% consistent, however.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Words in [square brackets] are greyed out because these are not written in the Sindarin text, but they are implied. E.g. "something [implied] here."
  </p>
  <p>
    Words between ‹single guillemets› mean a single Sindarin word includes the whole context in English, such as verbs with their respective pronouns.

    <span class="inner-link">Links in green/cyan</span> and <span class="inner-anchor">in pink</span> are internal. They belong to this website and open in the same tab (or window). The <span class="inner-link">green/cyan ones</span> will typically take you to <span class="inner-link">another page</span>, in the same website, with more information and examples. The <span class="inner-anchor">pink ones</span> will scroll you elsewhere in the very <span class="inner-anchor">same page</span> you are at the moment. <span class="fake_a">Blue anchors</span> will open a new tab and take you to other websites.
