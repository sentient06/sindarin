    Notes on conventions used
  </h3>
  <p>
    Before starting, you might notice that some words are highlighted like §this§ or §§this§§. This represents mutated words. Don't worry about it until you get to the mutations section.
  </p>
  <p>
    When an example is meant to highlight something, the keywords will be **bold**. If there are two concepts together, *italic* might also be used. (This is not 100% consistent, however.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Words in [square brackets] are greyed out because these are not written in the Sindarin text, but they are implied. E.g. "something [implied] here."
  </p>
  <p>
    Words between ‹single guillemets› mean a single Sindarin word includes the whole context in English, such as verbs with their respective pronouns.

    <span class="inner-link">Links in green/cyan</span> and <span class="inner-anchor">in pink</span> are internal and open in the same tab/window. The <span class="inner-link">green/cyan ones</span> will typically take you to <span class="inner-link">another page</span> with more information and examples. The <span class="inner-anchor">pink ones</span> will scroll you elsewhere in the <span class="inner-anchor">same page</span>.
