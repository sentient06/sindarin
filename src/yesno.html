  %section% Yes and No
</h2>
<p>
  There are no examples of "yes" and "no" in the Sindarin corpus.
</p>
<p>
  The general recommendation is to use the <b>u-negation</b> as a standalone word <b>û</b> for "no", and a neologism <b>naw</b> for "yes".
</p>
<p>
  <b>Naw</b> is based on Quenya <i>ná</i>.
</p>
<p>
  <small>
    There is a case for using <b>lá</b> as a word for "no", but based on empirical experimentation speaking Neo-Sindarin, people reportedly mistook yes for no too often to be considered a realistic choice.
