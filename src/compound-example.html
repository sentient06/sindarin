<p>
  Making compound words in Sindarin is a complicated business and out of scope of this page. The reason why it's complicated is because Sindarin words derive from Common Eldarin and to make convincing words one must first revert the elements of the composition back to <abbr title="Common Eldarin">CE</abbr> and then revise all the phonetic changes from <abbr title="Common Eldarin">CE</abbr> to Ancient Telerin, then from that language into Old Sindarin, and then into Sindarin itself.

<p>
  Take the following illustration shared by Elaran from the Vinyë Lambengolmor server as an example:
</p>
<h4>
  Creating a compound for "Fire Lord"
</h4>
<p>
  Let's combine **naur** & **hîr** which are "fire" & "lord", for what should be a simple example:
</p>
<p>
  *Would **Naurhîr** work?*
</p>
<p>
  No. With certain exceptions like annûn & amrûn, no polysyllabic word can have a circumflexed (i.e. over-long) vowel, the circumflex always becomes acute (i.e. î &gt; í, shortening the over-long vowel to a long vowel).
</p>
<p>
  *Then, would **Naurhír** work?*
</p>
<p>
  No. With exceptions, no polysyllabic word can have a long vowel in the final syllable.
</p>
<p>
  *Then, would **Naurhir** work?*
</p>
<p>
  No. In compounds the second element is often lenited (h &gt; ch), unless the preceding consonant requires another mutation.
</p>
<p>
  *Then, would **Naurchir** work?*
</p>
<p>
  No. With exceptions, AU in polysyllabic words become Ó/O as with glaur + findel = Glorfindel.
</p>
<p>
  *Then, would **Norchir** work?*
</p>
<p>
  No. Unlike glaur (&lt;- (g)law-rē), the AU in naur (&lt;- nār) comes from ancient long A, which in the Common Eldarin stage should get shortened before a consonant cluster like "rch", so it should become plain/short A, as we see with Narwain = naur + gwain.
</p>
<p>
  *Then, would **Narchir** work?*
</p>
<p>
  Yes!
</p>
<p>
  *Shouldn't it be **Nerchir** due to I-affection (which turns O and A into E if there is an I in the following syllable)?*
</p>
<p>
  No, because the I-affection rules take place before the "ē&gt;i" rule (i.e. hēr&gt;hīr) and "e" does not cause "i" affection, hence not "Rendir" but Randir = raun(&lt;rān) + (n)dîr(&lt;ndēr).
</p>
<p>
  *How many rules do I have to learn if I want to form names properly?*
</p>
<p>
  At least 75.

  A summarised explanation of the rules has been published by Rínor from the Vinyë Lambengolmor server on this page:

</p>
<p>
  There you can also find examples for the rules and some compounds with their equivalent primitive forms.
</p>
<p>
  There are efforts into automating some of these rules to minimise manual checks for this kind of work, but at the date of this text, these efforts have not been successfully implemented yet.
