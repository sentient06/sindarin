<h4>
  Half-strong verbs
</h4>
<p>
  Sindarin has a minor class of verbs called half-strong verbs.
</p>
<p>
  Half-strong verbs are a subclass of derived verbs whose past-tense formation preserves patterns inherited from Common Eldarin and Quenya half-strong verbs. The evidence is limited but consistent.
</p>
<p>
  These verbs were originally derived causative verbs formed with the suffix <b>-ta</b> (Common Eldarin <b>-tā</b>). Their past tense was created not with a regular dental suffix, but by strengthening or infixing the root, producing forms with <b>-nt-</b>.
</p>
<p>
  One of the best evidences is the verb <b>tangad(a)-</b>, meaning "to make firm, confirm" (&lt; ✶tankāta-), from Noldorin (1930s). It's present tense is <i>tangod</i> and its past tense is <i>tangant</i>. Sindarin still have traces of this system in several ways.
</p>
<p>
  A more recent verb in the Sindarin development that serve as example of a causative half-strong verb is the verb <b>covad(a)-</b>, meaning "to make meet". Present <i>covad</i> and past <i>covant</i>. This mirrors the Noldorin pattern and demonstrates that the class survived into Sindarin.
</p>
<p>
  Some general properties of half-strong verbs are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>They are derived verbs</li>
  <li>They are typically causative</li>
  <li>They are formed historically with -tā (S. ending –da/-tha/-a in later forms)</li>
  <li>Their past tense formed by strengthening the root, giving -nt</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Example of a half-strong verb:
