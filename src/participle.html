<p>
  Sindarin divides its participles into <b>active</b> participles and <b>passive</b> participles.
</p>
<p>
  For intransitives or natural processes ("to grow", "to fall"), in a sentence like "the grown maiden", active participles are more adequate, because using the passive would wrongly imply an external agent (something "grew" the maiden).
</p>
<p>
  The active participle is split into past and present participles. The passive participle has merged both functions into the past passive participle, so there's only one type.
</p>
<h4>
  Active participles
</h4>
<p>
  Sindarin has two active participles that behave like adjectives: a present/continuous participle in <b>-ol</b> and a past/perfective participle in <b>-iel</b>.
</p>
<p>
  The present participle (<b>-ol</b>) historically comes from an ancient continuative marker combined with an active participial ending, giving the sense "currently doing."
</p>
<p>
  The past participle (<b>-iel</b>) is derived from the old Common Eldarin perfect plus the same participial suffix, producing the sense "having done."
</p>
<p>
  Tolkien originally used forms like <i>tíriel</i> as present participles, but later reinterpreted them as perfective ("having gazed"), and created new present forms (e.g., <i>tiriel</i>) to contrast with them. The result is a system where <b>-ol</b> marks ongoing action and <b>-iel</b> marks completed action, both ultimately descending from ancient participial formations.
</p>

<h5>
  Present Active Participle
</h5>
<p>
  Use present active participles as adjectives describing someone who is currently doing the action. Example:
</p>
<pre>
  en·adan anu na §bâr§vâr§ §tín§dín§ **norol** = "the man went to his house **running**"
  Aragorn, **hennol** §parf§barf§, egin §Boromir§Voromir§ anglennol = "Aragorn, **reading** a book, saw Boromir approaching"
</pre>
<p>
  The mechanics of how to form it are simple:
</p>
<h6>
  Basic verbs
</h6>
<p>
  Add **-ol** to the verb stem.
</p>
<pre>
  cen- → cenol = "seeing"
  car- → carol = "doing"
  nor- → norol = "running"
</pre>
<h6>
  Derived verbs (ending in -a)
</h6>
<p>
  Replace **-a** with **-ol**:
</p>
<pre>
   gala- → galol  = "growing"
  lasta- → lastol = "listening"
  tiria- → tiriol = "gazing" (attested via mutation: diriel)
</pre>

<h6>
  Mutation
</h6>
<p>
  Participles behave like adjectives: they §soft-mutate§ after a prefix (§*garol*§ from *carol* after **ú-** → *ú§garol§*, *rhu§garol§*, etc.)
</p>

<h5>
  Past / Perfective Active Participle
</h5>
<p>
  Use past active participles as describing someone/something that has completed an action. Example:
</p>
<pre>
  e·§'wend§ §góliel§**'óliel**§ = "the maiden **‹has grown›**"
  Aragorn, **henniel** e·§tain§dain§, evin §hestad§chestad§ §Boromir§Voromir§ - Aragorn, **‹having read›** the letter, went to seek Boromir"
</pre>
<h6>
  Basic verbs
</h6>
<p>
  Add -iel, with vowel-lengthening of the base vowel:
</p>
<pre>
  car- → córiel = "having done"
  cen- → cíniel = "having seen"
  nor- → núriel = "having run"
</pre>
<h6>
  Derived verbs (ending in -a/-ia)
</h6>
<p>
  Replace -a / -ia with -iel.
</p>
<p>
  If the verb stem does not end in a consonant cluster, lengthen the base vowel.
</p>
<p>
  If the stem does end in a cluster, no vowel lengthening - instead apply i-affection if expected:
</p>
<pre>
   gala- → góliel
  tiria- → tíriel
  lasta- → lestiel
  ortha- → erthiel
</pre>

<h5>
  Plural Forms
</h5>
<p>
  Most Neo-Sindarin practice do not pluralise active participles. Thus:
</p>
<pre>
  adan norol  = "running man"
  edain norol = "running men"
</pre>

<h5>
  Special Note: Short-vowel tiriel
</h5>
<pre>
  tíriel = past participle "having gazed"
  tiriel = present participle "gazing" (a special form created for poetic and phonological reasons).
</pre>
<p>
  <i>
    This does not affect the general rules above.
  </i>
</p>

<h4>
  Passive participles
</h4>
<p>
  Passive participles describe a state resulting from an action ("slain", "broken", "closed").
</p>
<p>
  They are used as adjectives:
</p>
<pre>
  en·adan <b>nangen</b>  = "the <b>slain</b> man" (from dag- [nd-])
  in·edain <b>nengin</b> = "the <b>slain</b> men"
</pre>
<h6>
  Basic verbs
</h6>
<p>
  Passive participles do not use the (modern) past tense. They are always built from the ancient nasal-infixed past stem, which survives only in the passive.
</p>
<p>
  The mechanic is rather phonetic: insert <code>/n/</code> after the stem consonant and add <b>-en</b>; the exact result depends on the final consonant. Examples:
</p>
<pre>
  <b>Final consonant  Passive participle pattern  Example</b>
  b                mm + en                     heb-   →  hemmen "kept"
  d                nn + en                     mad-   →  mannen "eaten"
  dh               nn + en                     badh-  →  bannen "judged"
  f/ph             mm + en                     raph-  →  rammen "seized"
  g                ng + en                     dag-   →  dangen "slain"
  l                ll + en                     hol-   →  hollen "closed"
  n                nn + en                     cen-   →  cennen "seen"
  r                rn + en                     tir-   →  tirnen "guarded"
  th               nn + en                     path-  →  pannen "smoothed"
  v                mm + en                     lav-   →  lammen "licked"
  w                usually nw → -nwen          gwae-  →  gwanwen "departed"
</pre>

<h6>
  Derived verbs (ending in -nna)
</h6>
<p>
  These often collapse instead of forming <b>-nnannen</b>:
</p>
<pre>
   onna- → onnen  "born"
  danna- → dannen "fallen"
</pre>
<h5>
  Plural Forms
</h5>
<p>
  Passive participles agree in number with their noun. Attested examples:
</p>
<pre>
  gwanwen → gwenwin
  onnen   → oennin (later ennin, Ebennin)
</pre>
