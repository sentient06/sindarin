  Questions in Sindarin simply look like regular indicative statements with a questioning intonation, the same way many Romance languages deal with it.

<pre>
  e·§brôg§vrôg§ §borg§vorg§  = "the bear [is] big"
  e·§brôg§vrôg§ §borg§vorg§? = "[is] the bear big?"

  There are no attested forms of interrogative pronouns, except for <b>ma/man</b> in the mysterious <a href="https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-2074819073.html" target="_blank">Túrin Wrapper</a>:
</p>
<pre>
  <b>man</b> agorech? = "<b>what</b> have we done?"
</pre>
<p>
  Most Neo-Sindarin writers assume <b>ma/man</b> can mean both "what" and "who".
</p>
<p>
  A paradigm for Neo-Sindarin interrogative pronouns has been proposed by Fiona Jallings and improved by Paul Strack.
</p>
<p>
  The words are formed by using the question word <b>ma/man</b> as a prefix followed by prepositions. The result is thus:
</p>
<pre>
  an  + man = <b>amman</b> "for what, why"
  mi  + man = <b>mivan</b> "in/at what, where"
  na  + man = <b>navan</b> "at/to what, where, whither"
  o   + man = <b>oman</b>  "from what, whence" (use stop mutation)
  mo  + man = <b>movan</b> "by means of what, how"
  man + lû  = <b>mallú</b> "what time, when"
</pre>
<p>
  Eldarin languages have **wh-movement**. **Wh-movement** is a syntactic process in which a *wh-word* (e.g. who, what, which, where, why) is displaced from its original position to the front of a clause, typically to form a question or a relative clause. Examples:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Declarative: You saw *what*.</li>
  <li>With **wh-movement**: *What* did you see?</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Therefore, the reconstructed pronouns are typically positioned at the start of the sentences.
</p>
<p>
  Object mutation shouldn't apply to these pronouns. There are several reasons for that, but the most important one is because mutations are triggered by syntactic relations, and the syntactic relations of wh-words in a language with wh-movement is not the same as it would be without movement. That said, most of these pronouns also start with an **m-**, and they start sentences, so it's safe to simply avoid mutations.
</p>
<p>
  If the question with the pronoun happens to be a subordinate question, just use commas. (The meaning changes slightly.) Example:
</p>
<pre>
  **man** cenig min feleg?     = "**what** ‹you see› ‹in the› cave?"
  cenig, **man** da min feleg? = "‹you see›, **what** is ‹in the› cave?"
</pre>
