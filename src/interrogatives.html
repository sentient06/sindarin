  Questions in Sindarin simply look like regular indicative statements with a questioning intonation, the same way many Romance languages deal with it.

<pre>
  e·§s{vrôg|brôg} §s{vorg|borg}  = "the bear [is] big"
  e·§s{vrôg|brôg} §s{vorg|borg}? = "[is] the bear big?"
</pre>

  There are no attested forms of interrogative pronouns, except for <b>ma/man</b> in the mysterious <a href="https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-2074819073.html" target="_blank">Túrin Wrapper</a>:
</p>
<pre>
  <b>man</b> agorech? = "<b>what</b> have we done?"
</pre>
<p>
  Most Neo-Sindarin writers assume <b>ma/man</b> can mean both "what" and "who".
</p>
<p>
  A paradigm for Neo-Sindarin interrogative pronouns has been proposed by Fiona Jallings and improved by Paul Strack.
</p>
<p>
  The words are formed by using the question word **ma/man**, prefixed with prepositions. The result is thus:
</p>
<pre>
  an  + man = **amman** "for what, why"
  mi  + man = **mivan** "in/at what, where"
  na  + man = **navan** "at/to what, where, whither"
  o   + man = **oman**  "from what, whence" (use stop mutation)
  mo  + man = **movan** "by means of what, how"
  man + lû  = **mallú** "what time, when"
</pre>
<p>
  Eldarin languages have **wh-movement**. **Wh-movement** is a syntactic process in which a *wh-word* (e.g. who, what, which, where, why) is displaced from its original position to the front of a clause, typically to form a question or a relative clause. Examples:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Declarative: You saw *what*.</li>
  <li>With **wh-movement**: *What* did you see?</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Therefore, the reconstructed pronouns are typically positioned at the start of the sentences.
</p>
<p>
  Object mutation shouldn't apply to these pronouns. There are a couple of reasons for that, but the most important one is because mutations are triggered by syntactic relations, and wh-words don't fit the expected relation that triggers mutations.
</p>
<p>
  If the question with the pronoun happens to be a subordinate question, just use commas. (The meaning changes slightly.) Example:
</p>
<pre>
  **man** cenig min feleg?     = "**what** ‹you see› ‹in the› cave?"
  cenig, **man** da min feleg? = "‹you see›, **what** is ‹in the› cave?"
</pre>
