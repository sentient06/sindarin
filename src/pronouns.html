<h4>
  Independent personal pronouns
</h4>

<p>
  In Sindarin, we don't use traditional personal pronouns. That's because pronouns are typically represented as suffixes to conjugated verbs.
</p>
<p>
  There are, however, independent pronouns, which can be used on certain circumstances (such as when a subject has been mentioned and needs to be referred to again):
</p>
<pre>
  <b>Singular</b>

  1st person I/me       <b>ni</b>
  2nd person thou       <b>ci</b>
  2nd person (polite)   <b>le</b>
  3rd person he/she/it  <b>te</b>

  <b>Plural</b>

  1st person we         <b>me</b>
  2nd person you        <b>de</b>
  3rd person they       <b>ti</b>

  Reflexive pronoun     <b>im</b>
</pre>

<p>
  The last pronoun "im" means "self" ("same") and is used for all persons. It has a meaning of "I myself", "he himself", "you yourselves", and so on.
</p>
<h4>
  Pronominal endings
</h4>
<p>
  In Romance languages, among others, there is a concept known as "implied subject", or "understood subject". It might also be called "elliptical subject" or "zero subject".
</p>
<p>
  An implied subject refers to a subject that is not explicitly stated but is understood from context, mostly because of how the verb is conjugated.
</p>
<p>
  In English, one example is the "you" in imperative sentences, e.g. "go home!" → "[You] go home!".
</p>
<p>
  In Sindarin, implied subjects are used at all times, except if absolutely required for the sentence to make sense. As in Romance languages, the verb is modified. In Sindarin, that means that a suffix is used.
</p>
<p>
  The suffixes used with verbs are the following:
</p>

<pre>
  <b>Singular</b>

  1st person I            <b>-n</b>
  2nd person thou         <b>-g</b>
  2nd person (polite)     <b>-l</b>
  2nd person (archaic)    <b>-dh</b>
  3rd person he/she/it    (nothing)
  
  <b>Plural</b>

  1st person we (not you) <b>-f</b>
  1st person we (and you) <b>-b</b>
  2nd person you          <b>-gir</b>
  2nd person (polite)     <b>-dhir</b>
  3rd person they         <b>-r</b>
</pre>

<h5>
  Example for all personal pronouns
</h5>
<p>
  Verb gala- ("to grow"):
</p>
<pre>
   I grow    - galon
Thou growest - galog
Thou growest - galol (polite)
Thou growest - galodh (archaic)
  He grows   - gala

  we grow    - galof
  we grow    - galab
 you grow    - galgir
 you grow    - galodh / galodhir (polite)
they grow    - galar
</pre>

<h4>
  Reflexive pronoun
</h4>
<p>
  In Sindarin, there is a reflexive pronoun <b>im</b> attested in multiple places, confirmed by Tolkien in notes from 1969.
</p>
<p>
  It is a general reflexive usable with all persons, equivalent to "self":
</p>
<pre>
  e·§hedhyd§chedhyd§ estanner **im** khazâd = "the dwarves called **themselves** khazâd"
</pre>
<p>
  <b>Im</b> can also be used as intensifier:
</p>
<pre>
  Melian nî redhin an **im** Ivann = "Melian was related to Yavanna **herself**"
</pre>
