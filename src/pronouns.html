<h4>
  Independent personal pronouns
</h4>

<p>
  In Sindarin, we don't use traditional personal pronouns. That's because pronouns are typically represented as suffixes to conjugated verbs.
</p>
<p>
  There are, however, independent pronouns, which can be used on certain circumstances (such as when a subject has been mentioned and needs to be referred to again):
</p>
<pre>
  **Singular**

  1st person I/me       **ni**
  2nd person thou       **ci**
  2nd person (polite)   **le** &#42;
  3rd person he/she/it  **te**

  **Plural**

  1st person we (excl.) **me**
  1st person we (incl.) **pe**
  2nd person you        **de**
  3rd person they       **ti**

  Reflexive pronoun     **im**
</pre>
<p>
  ±&#42; *le* is a loanword from Quenya±
</p>
<h5>
  Reflexive pronoun
</h5>
<p>
  In Sindarin, there is a reflexive pronoun <b>im</b> attested in multiple places, confirmed by Tolkien in notes from 1969.
</p>
<p>
  It is a general reflexive usable with all persons, equivalent to "self". It has a meaning of "I myself", "he himself", "you yourselves", and so on.
</p>
<pre>
  i·§n{chedhyd|hedhyd} estanner **im** khazâd = "the dwarves called **themselves** khazâd"
</pre>
<p>
  <b>Im</b> can also be used as intensifier:
</p>
<pre>
  Melian nî redhin an Ivann **im** = "Melian was related to Yavanna **herself**"
</pre>

<h4>
  Pronominal endings
</h4>
<p>
  In Romance languages, among others, there is a concept known as "implied subject", or "understood subject". It might also be called "elliptical subject" or "zero subject".
</p>
<p>
  An implied subject refers to a subject that is not explicitly stated but is understood from context, mostly because of how the verb is conjugated.
</p>
<p>
  In English, one example is the "you" in imperative sentences, e.g. "go home!" → "[You] go home!".
</p>
<p>
  In Sindarin, implied subjects are used at all times, except if absolutely required for the sentence to make sense. As in Romance languages, the verb is modified. In Sindarin, that means that a suffix is used.
</p>
<p>
  The suffixes used with verbs are the following:
</p>

<pre>
  <b>Singular</b>

  1st person I            <b>-n</b>
  2nd person thou         <b>-g</b>
  2nd person (polite)     <b>-l</b>
  2nd person (archaic)    <b>-dh</b>
  3rd person he/she/it    (nothing)
  
  <b>Plural</b>

  1st person we (not you) <b>-f</b>
  1st person we (and you) <b>-b</b>
  2nd person you          <b>-gir</b>
  2nd person (polite)     <b>-dhir</b>
  3rd person they         <b>-r</b>
</pre>

<h5>
  Example for all personal pronouns
</h5>
<p>
  Verb gala- ("to grow"):
</p>
<pre>
   I grow    - galo**n**
Thou growest - galo**g**
Thou growest - galo**l** (polite)
Thou growest - galo**dh** (archaic)
  He grows   - gala

  we grow    - galo**f**
  we grow    - gala**b**
 you grow    - galo**gir**
 you grow    - galo**dhir** (polite)
they grow    - gala**r**
</pre>
