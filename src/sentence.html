<h4>
  Direct objects
</h4>
<p>
  Direct objects are a word or phrase in a sentence referring to the person or thing receiving the action of a transitive verb.
</p>
<p>
  For example, in English, in "mail the letter and call him", "the letter" and "him" are direct objects. 
</p>
<p>
  In Sindarin, direct objects undergo §s{soft mutation}. Examples:
</p>
<pre>
  lasto §s{beth|peth} lammen = "listen [to the] word (peth) [of] ‹my tongue›"
  cenin §s{'aladh|galadh}      = "I see a tree (galadh)"
  annon §s{higil|sigil} adan  = "I give a man (adan) a knife (sigil)" 
</pre>

<h4>
  Word order
</h4>
<p>
  Sindarin normally places the <span class="c1">subject</span> first, the <span class="c2">verb</span> second, and the <span class="c3">direct object</span> third. The <span class="c4">indirect object</span> follows the direct object. This gives the basic pattern:
</p>
<pre>
  <span class="c1">Subject</span> – <span class="c2">Verb</span> – <span class="c3">Direct object</span> – <span class="c4">Indirect object</span>
</pre>
<p>
  Example:
</p>
<pre>
  <span class="c1">e·vaethor</span> <span class="c2">ón</span> <span class="c3">e·ledil</span> <span class="c4">eni chothron</span> = "the warrior gave the key ‹to the› captain"
</pre>
<ul>
  <li>Subject: the warrior</li>
  <li>Verb: gave</li>
  <li>Direct object: the key</li>
  <li>Indirect object: to the captain</li>
</ul>
<p>
  This pattern can be called S-V-DO-IO or SVO for short (DO and IO are merged into O "object".)
</p>
<p>
  SVO is the standard and only basic word order explicitly described for Sindarin. Yet there are exceptions.
</p>

<h5>
  Behaviour and exceptions
</h5>
<h6>
  The indirect object may be moved
</h6>
<!--
In Sindarin the <span class="c4">indirect object</span> is generally marked with the preposition <b>an</b> "to, for" (in the dative), which makes its placement freer within the sentence, much the same way that using the preposition "to" or "for" makes the placement of the indirect object freer in English ("to the Edain I gave hope").
-->
<p>
  The indirect object is often marked by a preposition, giving it flexible placement.
</p>
<pre>
  <span class="c4"><b>an Edain</b></span> <span class="c2">ónen</span> <span class="c3">estel</span>               = "<span class="c4"><b>to the Edain</b></span> <span class="c2">‹I gave›</span> <span class="c3">hope</span>"
  <span class="c4"><b>eni chothron</b></span> <span class="c1">e·vaethor</span> <span class="c2">ón</span> <span class="c3">e·ledil</span> = "<span class="c4"><b>‹to the› captain</b></span> <span class="c1">the warrior</span> <span class="c2">gave</span> <span class="c3">the key</span>"
</pre>

<h6>
  The direct object is marked by lenition
</h6>
<p>
  The direct object undergoes §s{soft mutation} whether it appears after the verb or is fronted for emphasis. Because of this mutation marking, the direct object also has limited freedom to move.
</p>
<pre>
  im Narvi **§s{hain|sain}** echant

  san  → "that", singular
  sain → "those", plural of *san*
  §s{hain} → "those", mutated form of *sain*

  Literal translation:
  
  myself Narvi **those** made
</pre>

<h6>
  The imperative has its own word order
</h6>
<p>
  The Sindarin imperative is used for commands and for the expression of a wish (<i>cuio i·Pheriain anann</i> = "live the Halflings long"). It follows <abbr title="Verb - Obect - Subject">VOS</abbr>.
</p>
<p>
  In the imperative, the subject follows the verb, and the verb always appears at the beginning of the phrase.
</p>
<p>
  See more details at the <a href="#imperative" class="inner-anchor">imperative section of the page</a>. Example:
</p>
<pre>
  <span class="c2">pedo</span> <span class="c3">mellon</span>            = "<span class="c2">speak</span>, <span class="c3">friend</span>"
  <span class="c2">edro</span> <span class="c3">en·annon</span>, <span class="c1">Aragorn</span> = "<span class="c2">open</span> <span class="c3">the gate</span>, <span class="c1">Aragorn</span>"
</pre>

<h5>
  Other word order patterns
</h5>
<!--
<h6>
  Subject-Verb-Object (SVO)
</h6>
<p>
  Sindarin follows SVO order as its primary structure, with the subject first, then the verb, then the object(s). This is similar to English and different from Welsh (which is VSO).
</p>
<pre>
  <span class="c1">e·vaethor</span> <span class="c2">dírant</span> <span class="c3">e·gorf</span> = "the warrior saw the ring"
</pre>
-->
<h6>
  Adjective After Noun
</h6>
<p>
  Unlike English, adjectives follow the nouns they modify rather than preceding them. This is one of the major differences from English word order.
</p>
<pre>
  bas <b>ilaurui</b> = "<b>daily</b> bread" <small>(lit.) "bread <b>daily</b>"</small>
</pre>

<h6>
  Genitive (Possessive) After Noun
</h6>
<p>
  Genitive expressions place the possessing/qualifying noun after the primary noun, in the same position as adjectives.
</p>
<pre>
  aran Moria = "king [of] Moria"
</pre>

<h6>
  Compound Words: Modified + Modifier
</h6>
<p>
  In compounds, the modifying element typically appears after the element being modified, following the adjective-after-noun pattern.
</p>
<pre>
  aeluin = "blue lake" → ael "lake" + luin "blue"
</pre>
<!--
<h6>
  Direct Object Before Indirect Object
</h6>
<p>
  The <span class="c3">direct object</span> follows the <span class="c2">verb</span> first, then the <span class="c4">indirect object</span> follows. This is opposite to English default order where indirect objects can precede direct objects.
</p>
<pre>
  <span class="c2">ónen</span> <span class="c3">i·Estel</span> <span class="c4">Edain</span>* = "I gave Hope to the Edain" (literally: I-gave Hope Edain)
</pre>
-->
<!--
<h6>
  Object Pronoun Before Verb
</h6>
<p>
  Independent pronoun objects (especially dative pronouns like le "to you") can appear immediately before the verb rather than after it, causing mutation of the following verb.
</p>
<pre>
  <span class="c3">le</span> <span class="c2">linnathon</span> = "to-you I-will-sing" <small>(from A Elbereth Gilthoniel)</small>
</pre>
-->
<h6>
  Preposition Before Noun
</h6>
<p>
  Like English, prepositions precede the noun phrase they qualify.
</p>
<pre>
  <b>n'</b>orod = "<b>to the</b> mountain"
</pre>

<h6>
  Relative Pronoun Before Subordinate Clause
</h6>
<p>
  Relative pronouns precede their subordinate clauses, similar to English structure.
</p>
<pre>
  en·adan <b>i</b> padrast = "the man <b>who</b> walked"
</pre>

<!--
<hr>
<p>
  The word order of transitive verbs in Sindarin is usually <b><span class="c1">Subject</span>-<span class="c2">Predicate</span>-<span class="c3">Object</span></b> (SPO):
</p>
<pre>
  <span class="c1">Aragorn</span> <span class="c2">anglennatha</span> <span class="c3">e·Varanduiniant</span>. = "<span class="c1">Aragorn</span> <span class="c2">will approach</span> <span class="c3">the Baranduin Bridge</span>"
  <span class="c1">Te</span> <span class="c2">aníra suilannad</span> <span class="c3">vellyn în</span>.        = "<span class="c1">He</span> <span class="c2">wants to greet</span> <span class="c3">his friends</span>"
</pre>

<p>
  However, if the object is a pronoun, the word order is <b><span class="c1">Subject</span>-<span class="c3">Object</span>-<span class="c2">Predicate</span></b> (SOP):
</p>
<pre>
  <span class="c1">Narvi</span> <span class="c3">hain</span> <span class="c2">echant</span> = "Narvi made them" = (lit.) "<span class="c1">Narvi</span> <span class="c3">them</span> <span class="c2">made</span>"
</pre>

<p>
  For intransitive verbs and predicative adjectives, the word order is <b><span class="c2">Predicate</span>-<span class="c1">Subject</span></b> (PS):
</p>
<pre>
    <span class="c2">Tôl</span> <span class="c1">acharn</span>     = "Revenge comes"    = (lit.) "<span class="c2">Comes</span> <span class="c1">revenge</span>"
    <span class="c2">Brann</span> <span class="c1">en·annon</span> = "The gate is high" = (lit.) "<span class="c2">High</span> <span class="c1">the gate</span>"
</pre>

<div class="old">
  <h4>
    Old assumptions:
  </h4>
  <p>
    Relative clauses in Sindarin are introduced with the article i, which here functions as a relative pronoun.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the verb follows immediately afterward, some examples are known with and without mutation.
  </p>
  <p>
    We therefore assume that i can be used in both the singular and plural, with or without lenition.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the plural, "in" can also be used alternatively with a nasal mutation:
  </p>
  <pre>
     cuina- (live)    - Dor Firn/Gyrth i Guinar = "land of the dead who live"
     cuina- (live)    - Dor Gyrth i chuinar     = "land of the dead who live"
    gohena- (forgive) - i gohenam di            = "we who forgive them"
  </pre>
  <p>
    When combined with the dative, the contracted form ai "the...; for the; for those..." is used:
  </p>
  <pre>
      i gohenam di ai gerir úgerth ammen (which we forgive those who sin against us) [literally: "do sins", from car - (to do)]
  </pre>
</div>

<div class="new">
  <h4>
    New findings
  </h4>
  <p>
    According to PE23:
  </p>
  <p>
    Verbs following their
    <ul>
      <li>subjects,</li>
      <li>nouns or</li>
      <li>emphatic pronouns</li>
    </ul>
    go through soft mutation.
  </p>
  <p>
    The pronominal subjects of verbs had been agglutinated to the verbal stems already in CE.
  </p>
  <p>
    The normal sentence order in Quenya, Telerin, and Sindarin was <span class="c1">subject</span>, <span class="c2">verb</span>, <span class="c3">first object</span>, <span class="c4">second object</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    But order was probably freer in CE, and in any case the weaker unemphatic pronominal words were evidently usually subordinated to the important verb stem.
