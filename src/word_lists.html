<h4>
  Swadesh list
</h4>
<p>
  A Swadesh list is a compilation of forms and concepts which all languages, without exception, have terms for, such as star, hand, water, kill, sleep, and so forth. The number of such terms is small – a few hundred at most, or possibly less than a hundred. The inclusion or exclusion of many terms is up to debate and there are several different lists. The Swadesh list is named after linguist Morris Swadesh. Read more about it on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swadesh_list" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.

  I have compiled a Swadesh 207 list for Neo-Sindarin. Not all words are exactly what it seems, and there are multiple candidates for several of these. All of them are linked to Eldamo or explained as appropriate.

<h4>
  Silmarillion list
</h4>
<p>
  Given that Sindarin is a language from a different universe, and thus the Swadesh list wouldn't contain names of other races and concepts frequently used in Middle-earth, I have also checked the most common words in the Silmarillion, bar the common language terms, then removed some proper names, Sindarin words and repeated Swadesh words and put the top 100 in the table below, in alphabetical order.
