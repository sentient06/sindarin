      This is a compilation of notes I've made to use as reference for Neo-Sindarin. I've transformed my notes into a web page for easy access and put it here so everyone can use it.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the information here has been taken from Eldamo, Ardalambion, the Vinyë Lambengolmor server, the Parma Eldalamberon and Vinyar Tengwar journals, and some gaps have been filled with stuff from the books A Fan's Guide to Neo-Sindarin by Fiona Jallings, and A Gateway to Sindarin by David Salo. Quite a few hypotheses and theories that guide this content were taken from the fine people from Vinyë Lambengolmor, especially the users Lanto, Elaran, Parmandil, Vyacheslav, Rínor and Mithriel, among others.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a work in progress with no end in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm trying to add some topics here left unexplored elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't claim the content in this page to be correct. In fact, I've probably made many mistakes. I don't provide a lot of references to all things written here, as the purpose of this page is to be a guide and a reference, not a strict study of the Sindarin language.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this page, the terms Sindarin and Neo-Sindarin are used interchangeably, but this content is chiefly about Neo-Sindarin. I am of the opinion that pure Sindarin is unusable, but if you'd like the best summary on pure Sindarin, check Ardalambion and Eldamo. My approach is not particularly conservative, but not too creative either. Neologisms are used here as regular words, because without neologisms I think Sindarin would be very limited. If the reader wants more context on specific words, please check them on Eldamo and Vinyë Lambengolmor.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't explore the conceptual developments of Sindarin here, I don't discuss details of Gnomish nor Noldorin, and I don't debate much of Quenya. Eldamo and Ardalambion are much better sources for that.
    </p>

      If you find any issues with this content at all, please open an issue on this <a href="https://github.com/sentient06/sindarin/issues" target="_blank">GitHub Page</a>, or give me a nudge on Vinyë Lambengolmor and I will look into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all that in mind, I hope you enjoy this page and find this useful.
