      This is a compilation of notes I've made to use as reference for Neo-Sindarin. I've been transforming it into an HTML for easy access and I'm slowly trying to order it by topics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some stuff has been taken from Ardalambion, some from Eldamo, some from Vinyë Lambengolmor. I used Gateway to Sindarin from David Salo to fill some gaps, and hypotheses and theories from the fine people from Vinyë Lambengolmor, especially the users Lanto, Elaran, Parmandil, Vyacheslav, Rínor and Mithriel, among others.

    <p>
      This is a work in progress with no end in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm trying to add some topics here left unexplored elsewhere.

      In this page, Sindarin and Neo-Sindarin might be used interchangeably, but this is chiefly about Neo-Sindarin. I am of the opinion that pure Sindarin is unusable, and the best reference to it is Ardalambion. Neologisms are used here as regular words, and if the reader wants more context, please check the words on Eldamo.
