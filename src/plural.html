  %section% Plural formation
</h3>
<p>
  As mentioned previously, Sindarin plural words go through *umlaut*. Sindarin has a term for it: *prestanneth*, meaning "disturbance". Tolkien also referred to this phenomenon as *i-affection*. That is because Sindarin plurals happen due to an ancient vowel *i* that ceased to exist, but left other vowels altered.
</p>
<p>
  For example, the Sindarin word for "beard" is *fang*. In Old Eldarin, this word was *spangâ*, plural *spangâi*. In Old Sindarin it became *sphanga* on singular and *sphangi* on plural. Eventually it evolved to Sindarin *fang* with plural *feng*, where the original vowel "a" drifted towards the same quality of the plural ending *-i* before it was lost.
</p>
<p>
  These plural patterns are valid for both nouns and adjectives.
</p>
<p>
  We will refer to this process as **i-affection** from now on.
</p>
<p>
  There are 3 types of i-affection:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>internal i-affection</li>
  <li>final i-affection</li>
  <li>final i-intrusion</li>
</ul>

<h4>
  Internal i-affection
</h4>
<p>
  Occurs only in non-final syllables:
</p>
<pre>
  Non-final a → e: <b>a</b>dan  "man"    → <b>e</b>dain "men"
  Non-final o → e: <b>o</b>nod  "Ent"    → <b>e</b>nyd  "Ents"
  Non-final u → y: t<b>u</b>lus "poplar" → t<b>y</b>lys "poplars"

  *Archaically:*
  *Non-final o → œ: g<b>o</b>lodh "noldo" → g<b>œ</b>lydh "noldor"*

  Other vowels in non-final syllables (e, i, y) do not mutate.
  Long vowels in non-final syllables (í, ó, ú, ý) do not mutate.
</pre>

<h4>
  Final i-affection
</h4>
<p>
  Occurs only in final syllables:
</p>
<pre>
  Final a → e: n<b>a</b>rn  "tale"   → n<b>e</b>rn  "tales"
  Final e → i: edh<b>e</b>l "elf"    → edh<b>i</b>l "elves"
  Final ê → î: h<b>ê</b>n   "child"  → h<b>î</b>n   "children"
  Final o → y: <b>o</b>rch  "orch"   → <b>y</b>rch  "orcs"
  Final u → y: tul<b>u</b>s "poplar" → tyl<b>y</b>s "poplars"

  Other short vowels in final syllables (i, y) do not mutate.
</pre>

<h4>
  Final i-intrusion
</h4>
<p>
  Happens when the last syllable ends in a single consonant:
</p>
<pre>
  Intruded  a → ai: ad**a**n "man"   → ed**ai**n "men"
  Intruded  â → ai: b**â**r  "home"  → b**ai**r  "homes"
  Intruded  ô → ui: th**ô**n "pine"  → th**ui**n "pines"         - monosyllables only
  Intruded  û → ui: d**û**r  "dark"  → d**ui**r  "dark (plural)" - monosyllables only
  Intruded au → oe: n**au**g "dwarf" → n**oe**g  "dwarves"

  The long vowels î, ŷ in final syllables do not mutate.
  The vowels e/ê, o, u undergo final i-affection instead (to i/î, y, y).
</pre>

<h4>
  Rare diphthongs plurals
</h4>
<p>
  Plurals of rarer diphthongs are the result of other phonetic effects:
</p>
<pre>
  Rare oe → ui: <b>oe</b>w   "evil deed" → <b>ui</b>w  "evil deeds"
  Rare eu →  ŷ: t<b>eu</b>ch "chip"      → t<b>ŷ</b>ch "chips"
</pre>
<p>
  The diphthongs ae, ei, ai, ui do not normally mutate in plurals, even in final syllables, but there are some unusual plurals where they do. (See below.)
</p>
<p>
  Diphthongs never mutate in non-final syllables.
</p>

<h4>
  Unusual plurals
</h4>
<p>
  Sindarin has a number of plural patterns resulting from more obscure sound changes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <span>
      Long or short **ó**/**o** derived from *au* resists mutations in non-final syllables, and might mutate to **oe** in final syllables of recognised compounds.
    </span>
    <pre>
  **Ó**dhil → **Ó**dhel (&lt; ✶aw(a)delo) "Elf [who left for Aman]"
  R**o**dyn → R**o**don (= *raud* + *-on*) "Vala"</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>
      The diphthong **ai** in final syllables might mutated to **î** (monosyllable) or **i** (polysyllable) depending on the ancient form of the word.
    </span>
    <pre>  c**ai**r → c**î**r "ship" (✶kiryā)
  g**ai**l → g**î**l "star" (✶gilyā)</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>
      When a vowel mutates to **i** or **y** in its plural, it absorbs any preceding **i**, as in:
    </span>
    <pre>
  Min**ie**l → Mín**i**l, thal**io**n → thel**y**n.</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>
      When a polysyllable ends in a short vowel, it generally follows the same mutations as in polysyllables ending in a single consonant:
    </span>
    <pre>
  -a → -ai:   nadh**a** "fetter"     → nedh**ai** "fetters"
  -e → -i:     tel**e** "end"        → til**i**   "ends" 
  -o → -y:   duirr**o** "river bank" → duirr**y** "river banks"
  -u → -y:    hadh**u** "seat"       → hedh**y**  "seats"</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>
      One exception is when a final -a is derived from an ancient g > ʒ > -a, in which case in plurals:
    </span>
    <pre>
  -a → -i:     fel**a** → fil**i** "mine" ±&lt; ✶phelgā &lt; felʒi &lt; √PHELEG±</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>
      When a monosyllable ends in a long vowel, it generally follows the same mutations as in monosyllables ending in a single consonant:
    </span>
    <pre>
  -â → -ai:      i**â** "pit"    → i**ai**  "pits"
  -ê → -î:       t**ê** "line"   → t**î**   "lines"
  -ô → -ui:     dr**ô** "rut"    → dr**ui** "ruts"
  -û → -ui:      t**û** "muscle" → t**ui**  "muscles"</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>
      Diphthongs are immune to mutation except when in some monosyllables:
    </span>
    <pre>
  -êw → -îw:    t**êw** "letter" → t**îw**  "letters"
  -aw → -oe(w): r**aw** "wing"   → r**oew** "wings"</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>
      Some Sindarin plurals are formed with the plural suffix -in, either a remnant of an ancient n preserved in the plural, or a generalization of this suffix applied to other situations.
    </span>
    <pre>
  ael "lake" → ael**in** "lakes"</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>
      Sometimes the Sindarin plural becomes the base form, and a singular is derived from it using the suffixes -eg, -ig, -og or -od.
    </span>
    <pre>
  glam   "orcs"          → glam**og**   "orc"
  gwanūn "twins"         → gwanun**ig** "twin"
  lhaw   "ears"          → lhew**eg**   "ear"
  loth   "small flowers" → loth**eg**   "small flower"
  lhoth  "flowers"       → lhoth**od**  "flower"
  filig  "small birds"   → filig**od**  "small bird"</pre>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
  Class plural
</h3>
<p>
  Sindarin has a second plural form for classes of things, using suffixes like **-ath**, **-hoth** or **-rim**.
</p>
<pre>
  êl     "star" , elin   "stars"  , elen**ath**   "all stars".
  orch   "orc"  , yrch   "orcs"   , orch**oth**   "all orcs".
  Nogoth "Dwarf", Negyth "Dwarves", Nogoth**rim** "all Dwarves".
</pre>
<p>
  **-ath** is by far the most common class plural suffix, which seems to be the "default" suffix. It is the only one used with inanimate items like elenath "all stars" and sammath "(all of the) chambers".
</p>
<p>
  **-hoth** is mostly used for "bad" groups given its connotation of "horde".
</p>
<p>
  Some class plural suffixes **-rim**, **-hoth** and **-waith** are used for groups of people: orchoth, Rohirrim, Forodwaith. These mostly formed ordinary compounds.
</p>
<p>
  The suffix **-ath** may preserve (or restore) ancient final endings to words that were lost in the singular form.
</p>
<pre>
   êl     "star"     → elen**ath**    "all stars".
   Feir   "Mortal"   → Firi**ath**    "(all) Mortals".
   gail   "star"     → gili**ath**    "host of stars".
   Perian "Halfling" → Periann**ath** "Hobbits (as a race)".
   ceir   "ship"     → círi**ath**    "(all) ships".
   lhîn   "pool"     → lhini**ath**   "(all of the) pools".
   sîr    "river"    → siri**ath**    "(all of the) rivers".
</pre>

<h3>
  Dual remnants
</h3>
<p>
  Sindarin once had a dual inflection, used for pairs of objects, but in Sindarin this dual has fallen out of use because final vowels vanished in Sindarin.
</p>
<p>
  However, there are remnants of a dual in fossilized forms.
</p>
<pre>
  lhaw       "ears" (two ears of one person) (*slasū &gt; lhahu &gt; lhau)
  Orgaladhad "day of [the] Two Trees [of Valinor]" (galadh)
  samarad    "two neighbours" (sammar)
  nobad      "thumb and index finger (as a pair)" (lit.) "pickers"
  hent       "two eyes" (hen)
</pre>
