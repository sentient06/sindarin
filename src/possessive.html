  The possessive construction in Sindarin follows a standard similar to genitive, but the possessed noun needs to be definite and the possessor needs to show at the end of the chain. Example:
</p>
<pre>
  e·<span class="soft">dhring</span> Celebrimbor = "the hammer [of] Celebrimbor"
</pre>
<p>
  When there is no proper noun for the possessor, the possessive pronouns come into play.
</p>
<h3>
  Possessive pronouns
</h3>
<p>
  Sindarin has a set of possessive pronouns that seem to be very similar to, and possibly based on, the forms of independent pronouns.
</p>
<p>
  Most examples are from a single source, Tolkien's translation of Lord's Prayer into Sindarin: <i>Ae Adar Nín</i> from the 1950s.
</p>
<p>
  Based on these, it seems the possessive pronoun is formed by: a) adding n to the independent pronoun; and b) lengthening the base vowel, with the caveat that the long ē became ī as was usual in Sindarin’s phonetic history.
</p>
<p>
  Thus the following paradigm can be constructed:
</p>

<pre>
                        Singular                   Plural
  1st person            nín  "my/mine"             mín "our/ours"
  2nd person familiar   cín  "thy/thine"                 
  2nd person polite     lín  "thy/thine (polite)"  dín "your/yours"
  3rd person            tín  "his/her(s)/its"      tín "their/theirs"
</pre>
<p>
  In all attested uses of the Sindarin possessive pronouns, they follow the possessed noun and undergo <span class="soft">soft mutation</span> like adjectives do, which means they almost always appear in mutated form.
</p>
<p>
  Unlike English, the possessed noun is also preceded by the definite article.
</p>
<pre>
  e·<span class="soft">higil</span> <b>nín</b> = "my (nín) knife (sigil)" = (lit.) "the knife my"
  e·<span class="soft">degil</span> <span class="soft"><b>dín</b></span> = "his (tín) pen (tegil)"
</pre>
<p>
  There doesn't seem to be any difference using a "to be" statement and an attribution statement. This is a debated topic among Neo-Sindarin enthusiasts, but one hypothesis is that a statement of attribution should not be different from a statement of predication in this particular case, since both translate more or less the same idea. To disambiguate, perhaps the same can be done to the pronoun as if it were an adjective, and be positioned before the thing possessed for emphasis.
</p>
<pre>
  e·<span class="soft">gorf</span> <b>nín</b>  = "my ring"
  e·<span class="soft">gorf</span> <b>nín</b>  = "the ring is mine"
  <b>nín</b> e·<span class="soft">gorf</span>! = "the ring is mine!" <small>(emphatic)</small>
</pre>
<p>
  <small>
    <i>
      More adventurous enthusiasts might want to check David Salo's "to be" verb reconstruction for another way of disambiguating. Most Neo-Sindarin writers would not encourage a standalone "to be" verb, however, as it's not attested and thus considered a fan invention.
