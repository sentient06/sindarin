<p>
  The possessive construction in Sindarin follows the same standard to the genitive, and the possessor needs to be at the end of the chain. Example:
</p>
<pre>
  dring Celebrimbor = "[the] hammer [of] Celebrimbor"
</pre>
<p>
  When there is no proper noun for the possessor, the possessive pronouns come into play.
</p>
<pre>
  e·§dring§dhring§ §tín§dín§      = "his hammer"
</pre>
<h4>
  Possessive pronouns
</h4>
<p>
  Sindarin has a set of possessive pronouns that seem to be very similar to, and possibly based on, the forms of independent pronouns.
</p>
<p>
  Most examples are from a single source, Tolkien's translation of Lord's Prayer into Sindarin, *Ae Adar Nín*, from the 1950s.
</p>
<p>
  Based on these, it seems the possessive pronoun is formed by: a) adding **n** to the independent pronoun; and b) lengthening the base vowel, with the caveat that the long **ē** became **ī** as was usual in Sindarin’s phonetic history.
</p>
<p>
  Thus the following paradigm can be constructed:
</p>
<pre>
                        **Singular**                   **Plural**
  1st person            *nín*  "my/mine"             *mín* "our/ours"
  2nd person familiar   *cín*  "thy/thine"                 
  2nd person polite     *lín*  "thy/thine (polite)"  *dín* "your/yours"
  3rd person            *tín*  "his/her(s)/its"      *tín* "their/theirs"
</pre>
<p>
  In all attested uses of the Sindarin possessive pronouns, they follow the possessed noun and undergo §soft mutation§ like adjectives do, which means they almost always appear in mutated form.
</p>
<p>
  Unlike English, the possessed noun is also preceded by the definite article.
</p>
<pre>
  e·§sigil§higil§ <b>nín</b> = "my (nín) knife (sigil)" = (lit.) "the knife my"
  e·§tegil§degil§ §tín§**dín**§ = "his (tín) pen (tegil)"
</pre>
<p>
  There doesn't seem to be any difference using a "to be" statement and an attribution statement. This is a debated topic among Neo-Sindarin enthusiasts, but one hypothesis is that a statement of attribution should not be different from a statement of predication in this particular case, since both translate more or less the same idea. To disambiguate, perhaps the same can be done to the pronoun as if it were an adjective, and be positioned before the thing possessed for emphasis.
</p>
<pre>
  e·§corf§gorf§ **nín**  = "my ring"
  e·§corf§gorf§ **nín**  = "the ring is mine"
  **nín** e·§corf§gorf§! = "the ring is mine!" <small>(emphatic)</small>
</pre>
<p>
  <small>
    <i>
      More adventurous enthusiasts might want to check David Salo's "to be" verb reconstruction for another way of disambiguating. Most Neo-Sindarin writers would not encourage a standalone "to be" verb, however, as it's not attested and thus considered a fan invention.

<h4>
  Using adjectives in possessive constructions
</h4>
<p>
  To use adjectives, simply put the **adjective** after the noun as usual, and before the possessive *pronoun*:
</p>
<pre>
  mellon **rovaer** *nín* = "*my* **best** friend" = "friend **best** *mine*" (lit.)
</pre>
