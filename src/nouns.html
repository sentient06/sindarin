<p>
  Nouns can be definite or indefinite, singular or plural. There is no grammatical gender.
</p>
<p>
  Proper names are considered definite nouns. Other nouns are made definite by use of a definite article. There is a ||#articles||singular article and a plural article||.
</p>
<p>
  In Old Sindarin, the noun originally had three numbers: singular, plural and dual.
</p>
<p>
  The dual soon became obsolete, and only survives in a few fossilised words.
</p>
<p>
  Sindarin plurals are mostly made with vowel-changes, through a phenomenon called *ablaut*.
</p>
<p>
  Here is an example of a noun in its different states:
</p>
<pre>
  parf = "book"

              **Definite    Indefinite**
  **Singular**    e·§s{barf}      parf
  **Plural**      i·§n{pherf}     perf
</pre>
