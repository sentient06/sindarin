  %section% Basic nouns
</h2>
<p>
  Nouns can be definite or indefinite, singular or plural.
</p>
<p>
  Proper names are considered definite nouns. Other nouns are made definite by use of a definite article. There is a singular and a plural article.
</p>
<p>
  Plural nouns go through vowel mutations. They can be identified by these vowels.
</p>

<h3>
  Plural formation
</h3>
<p>
  Plurals in Sindarin go through a mutation known as <b>i-affection</b>. This is the result of an ancient plural suffix <b>ī</b> which has been lost in modern Sindarin plurals.
</p>
<p>
  There are 3 types of i-affection:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>internal i-affection</li>
  <li>final i-affection</li>
  <li>final i-intrusion</li>
</ul>

<h4>Internal i-affection</h4>
<p>
  Occurs only in non-final syllables:
</p>
<pre>
  Non-final a → e: <b>a</b>dan  "man"    → <b>e</b>dain "men"
  Non-final o → e: <b>o</b>nod  "Ent"    → <b>e</b>nyd  "Ents"
  Non-final u → y: t<b>u</b>lus "poplar" → t<b>y</b>lys "poplars"

  Other vowels in non-final syllables (e, i, y) do not mutate.
  Long vowels in non-final syllables (í, ó, ú, ý) do not mutate.
  Archaically:
  Non-final o → œ: g<b>o</b>lodh "Gnome" → g<b>œ</b>lydh "Gnomes"
</pre>

<h4>Final i-affection</h4>
<p>
  Occurs only in final syllables:
</p>
<pre>
  Final a → e: n<b>a</b>rn  "tale"   → n<b>e</b>rn  "tales"
  Final e → i: edh<b>e</b>l "elf"    → edh<b>i</b>l "elves"
  Final ê → î: h<b>ê</b>n   "child"  → h<b>î</b>n   "children"
  Final o → y: <b>o</b>rch  "orch"   → <b>y</b>rch  "orcs"
  Final u → y: tul<b>u</b>s "poplar" → tyl<b>y</b>s "poplars"

  Other short vowels in final syllables (i, y) do not mutate.
</pre>

<h4>Final i-intrusion</h4>
<p>
  Happens when the last syllable ends in a single consonant:
</p>
<pre>
  Intruded  a → ai: <b>a</b>dan "man"   → ed<b>ai</b>n "men"
  Intruded  â → ai: b<b>â</b>r  "home"  → b<b>ai</b>r  "homes"
  Intruded  ô → ui: th<b>ô</b>n "pine"  → th<b>ui</b>n "pines"         - monosyllables only
  Intruded  û → ui: d<b>û</b>r  "dark"  → d<b>ui</b>r  "dark (plural)" - monosyllables only
  Intruded au → oe: n<b>au</b>g "dwarf" → n<b>oe</b>g  "dwarves"

  The long vowels î, ŷ in final syllables do not mutate.
  The vowels e/ê, o, u undergo final i-affection instead (to i/î, y, y).
</pre>

<h4>Rare diphthongs plurals</h4>
<p>
  Plurals of rarer diphthongs are the result of other phonetic effects:
</p>
<pre>
  Rare oe → ui: <b>oe</b>w   "evil deed" → <b>ui</b>w  "evil deeds"
  Rare eu →  ŷ: t<b>eu</b>ch "chip"      → t<b>ŷ</b>ch "chips"
</pre>
<p>
  The diphthongs ae, ei, ai, ui do not normally mutate in plurals, even in final syllables, but there are some unusual plurals where they do.
</p>
<p>
  Diphthongs never mutate in non-final syllables.
</p>

<h4>Unusual plurals</h4>
<p>
  Sindarin has a number of plural patterns resulting from more obscure sound changes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <span>
      Long or short ó/o derived from au resists mutations in non-final syllables, and might mutate to oe in final syllables of recognized compounds.
    </span>
    <pre>
  Ódhil → Ódhel (&lt; ✶aw(a)delo) "Elf [who left for Aman]"
  Rodyn → Rodon (= raud + -on) "Vala"</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>
      The diphthong ai in final syllables might mutated to î (monosyllable) or i (polysyllable) depending on the ancient form of the word.
    </span>
    <pre>  cair → cîr "ship" (✶kiryā)
  gail → gîl "star" (✶gilyā)</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>
      When a vowel mutates to i or y in its plural, it absorbs any preceding i, as in:
    </span>
    <pre>
  Miniel → Mínil, thalion → thelyn.</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>
      When a polysyllable ends in a short vowel, it generally follows the same mutations as in polysyllables ending in a single consonant:
    </span>
    <pre>
  -a → -ai
  -e → -i
  -o → -y
  -u → -y</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>
      One exception is when a final -a is derived from an ancient g > ʒ > -a, in which case in plurals:
    </span>
    <pre>
  -a → -i</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>
      When a monosyllable ends in a long vowel, it generally follows the same mutations as in monosyllables ending in a single consonant:
    </span>
    <pre>
  -â → -ai
  -ê → -î
  -ô → -ui
  -û → -ui</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>
      Diphthongs are immune to mutation except when in some monosyllables:
    </span>
    <pre>
  -êw → -îw
  -aw → -oe(w)</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>
      Some Sindarin plurals are formed with the plural suffix -in, either a remnant of an ancient n preserved in the plural, or a generalization of this suffix applied to other situations.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>
      Sometimes the Sindarin plural becomes the base form, and a singular is derived from it using the suffixes -eg, -ig, -og or -od.
    </span>
  </li>
</ul>

</p>

<h3>Class plural</h3>
<p>
  Sindarin has a second plural form using suffixes like -ath, -hoth or -rim.
</p>
<pre>
  êl     "star" , elin   "stars"  , elenath   "all stars".
  orch   "orc"  , yrch   "orcs"   , orchoth   "all orcs".
  Nogoth "Dwarf", Negyth "Dwarves", Nogothrim "all Dwarves".
</pre>
<p>
  -ath is by far the most common class plural suffix, which seems to be the "default" suffix. It is the only one used with inanimate items like elenath "all stars" and sammath "(all of the) chambers".
</p>
<p>
  -hoth is mostly used for "bad" groups given its connotation of "horde".
</p>
<p>
  Some class plural suffixes -rim, -hoth and -waith are used for groups of people: orchoth, Rohirrim, Forodwaith. These mostly formed ordinary compounds.
</p>
<p>
  The suffix -ath may preserve (or restore) ancient final endings to words that were lost in the singular form.
</p>
<pre>
   êl     "star"     → elenath    "all stars".
   Feir   "Mortal"   → Firiath    "(all) Mortals".
   gail   "star"     → giliath    "host of stars".
   Perian "Halfling" → Periannath "Hobbits (as a race)".
N. ceir   "ship"     → círiath    "(all) ships".
N. lhîn   "pool"     → lhiniath   "(all of the) pools".
N. sîr    "river"    → siriath    "(all of the) rivers".
</pre>

<h3>Dual remnants</h3>
<p>
  Sindarin once had a dual inflection, used for pairs of objects, but in Sindarin this dual has fallen out of use because final vowels vanished in Sindarin.
</p>
<p>
  However, there are remnants of a dual in fossilized forms.
</p>
<pre>
  lheweg     "ears (of one person)" (*slasū > lhahu > lhau, spelled lhaw)
  Orgaladhad "Day of Two Trees (galadh)"
  samarad    "two neighbours (sammar)"
  nobad      "thumb and index finger as a pair, *(lit.) pickers"
  hent       "two eyes (hen)"
</pre>
