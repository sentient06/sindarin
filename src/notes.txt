There is some research suggesting that Proto-Uralic used diminutives to designate singular instances from words which are either inherently groups or non-discrete things.
Sindarin maybe uses diminutives that way too.

PREDICATION:

Adjectives:
Definite   → "the elf is tall"
  tond en·edhel = "tall [is] the elf"

Indefinite → "an elf is tall"
  tond edhel    = "tall [is] [an] elf"

  tond nodui edhel = "tall some elf"
  tynd edhil       = "tall elves"
  edhil tynd       = "elves tall"
  edhil ti dynd    = "elves they tall"

This is ambiguous and IMO would sooner be interpreted as "a tall Elf" with the non-standard / poetic word order.
If the intended meaning here is that some unspecified individual Elf is tall, then I would add a quantifier "some".
If, however, the intended meaning is that if an individual is an Elf, then that individual is tall, then this is a generic statement and would be better in plural, "Elves are tall".
And there it's a question of whether we accept ambiguity in tynd Edhil / Edhil tynd, or we add a pronoun to disambiguate the predicative meaning, Edhil ti dynd.
Adding a pronoun is functionally useful, but unattested.


Nouns:
Elf and King are both indefinite      → An elf is a king
  edhel te aran    = "[an] elf he [is] [a] king"

Elf is indefinite / King is definite: → An elf is the king
  er edhel en·aran = "one elf [is] the king"

Elf is definite / King is indefinite  → The elf is a king
  en·edhel aran    = "the elf [is] [a] king"

Elf and King are both definite:       → The elf is the king
  en·edhel te en·aran = "the elf he [is] the king" (maybe?)

ATTRIBUTION:

Adjectives:
Definite   → "the tall elf"
  en·edhel dond = "the elf tall"

Indefinite → "a tall elf"
  edhel dond    = "[an] elf tall"

Nouns:
Definite   → "the king elf" or "the elf king"
  en·edhelaran = "the elf-king"
  en·aran edhellen = "the king elvish"
  en·edhel arnen = "the elf kingish"

Indefinite → "a king elf" or "an elf king"
  edhelaran    = "elf-king"

I don't think these are valid.
I would recommend rephrasing such things with an adjective:
(en·)Aran Edhellen for "(the) Elf-king".
The reverse, "King-elf", seems somewhat odd to me in terms of semantics, but perhaps could be satisfactorily expressed as (en·)Edhel arnen.



GENITIVE
King and Elves are both indefinite → a king of elves
  aran edhil     = "[a] king [of] elves"
  aran nan edhil = "king of elves"

King is indefinite / Elves is definite: → a king of the elves

  aran nan in·edhil = "[a] king of the elves"*

King is definite / Elves is indefinite: → the king of elves

  en·aran nan edhil = "the king of elves"*

King and Elves are both definite → the king of the elves
  aran in·edhil = "[the] king [of] the elves"
  en·aran nan in·edhil = "the king of the elves"


The two * should be used situationally - mismatches definiteness in genitives results in relatively niche or odd readings.

Compared next to each other to avoid dupes:

aran edhil           = genitive indef indef                   - "[a] king [of] elves"       |

Verb lenition issue:

Why is pêd lenited in guren bêd enni while teithant is not lenited in Celebrimbor o Eregion teithant?

In light of the explicit statement in PE23 that verbs should be lenited after the subject, the current working hypothesis is that the lenition does not apply after complex subjects, that is subjects that contain more material after the noun. In the case of Celebrimbor o Eregion, the underlined part is an adjunct which may perhaps block the lenition.

https://discord.com/channels/397489292185960468/398407102344986625/1316100109204979802

I would say that verb lenition after the subject happens only if the subject is a single prosodic word, whereas here you have two, forming a phonological phrase without the verb. In simpler terms for anyone unfamiliar with the terms - if the subject is more than one word, the verb probably doesn't lenite.

https://eldamo.org/elvish-essays/late-sindarin-articles-and-mutations.html#2.0

Maybe relevant:

According to PE23 verbs following their subjects, nouns or emphatic pronouns. The pronominal subjects of verbs had been agglutinated to the verbal stems already in CE. The normal sentence order in Q., T., and S. was subject, verb, first object, second object. But order was probably freer in CE, and in any case the weaker unemphatic pronominal words were evidently usually subordinated to the important verb stem.


Existential:

S. dha v. “there is” (Category: Be)

A word appearing in the phrase inn đa v’im “(lit.) a mind (inn) there is in me = I have a good mind (to do so)” from Late Notes on Verb Structure (LVS) from 1969 (PE22/165). This phrase was first written as inn no v’im with {no >>} đa (PE22/165 note #108). This alteration suggests that đa is a heavily eroded/mutated form of na- “to be”, perhaps particular to this idiomatic phrase. As a counter-argument, đa is being used here in an existential statement “there is = *exists”, and these same 1969 notes state that:

    Stem of verb “exist” (have being in primary world of history) was √EŊE, distinct from √NA joining adjs./nouns/pronouns in statements (or wishes) asserting (or desiring) a thing to have a certain quality, or to be the same as another (PE22/147). 

This means that (in Quenya at least) NA was not used for existential statements. This opens up the possibility that đa is a mutated form of *da- “exists” from an otherwise unattested root *√DA, the Sindarin equivalent of √EÑ.

Neo-Sindarin: Given the speculative nature of this verb, I cannot currently recommend its use in Neo-Sindarin. It is, however, our only known means of making existential statements in that language.

https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1805153689.html

existential verb da-

nî guinas a glass: I'd use the existential da here, but that comes with two challenges - it's past tense (IMO daun), and whether and how to inflect it for plural. I never thought about the plural form of the past tense... Maybe it remains uninflected, maybe it becomes doner or dóner (< ✶dā·ne·r)? But that somewhat goes against the notion that it ought to be a clitic.

For "was not inclined" I used a twist of the attested inn dha v'im, with la < LĀ conceived as the negative equivalent of existential da, likewise formed as an unstressed element. This is somewhat experimental of me...

For one, inn no >> đa v’im “I have a good mind (to do so), (lit.) there is an ‘inn’ in me” has a different form
On Parf Edhellen there is !naw "yes, it is so" < NĀ and most dictionaries list S na- to account for the imperative no aer i eneth lín “hallowed be thy name”, but usually don't indicate that one should use it like any other verb. In the end, inventing a na- paradigm is simply not necessary in most peoples' views, so why take the risk?

https://discord.com/channels/397489292185960468/398407102344986625/1016276175657652265


In inn dha v’im, dha is most likely mutated by its  subject inn, so I would posit a base form da-   (cp. also dôd, dád in VT44/22)

https://discord.com/channels/397489292185960468/1425831601077485721/1425832571845214209

That development path seems very unlikely. The Editoral Team's explanation for ped-'s unexpected lenition is connected to the now-disappeared final vowel of guren < ʒorenjā which precedes ped- in the phrase. This is what we may be seeing with inn dha v'im < indō nā [i]mi-imni, with a doubly unexpected lenition of "N > Ð". Either that or √NA has a variant √DA.

Just on the margin: is this da "with" actually attested anywhere? 

No. It's speculation, tied to AD (cf. S. adh, but later a(h) from AS), treated as reversible DA.

https://discord.com/channels/397489292185960468/397490652096626698/412202982936018945


there's nothing clear-cut at all about eithro (both its meaning and possible history are just editorial guesses), but let's not go off topic. So, again, IMHO the exact semantics of dha don't matter as long as we limit its use to the attested "there is X in/at/on/under/etc. Y".

I don't think dha and thor are the same lexeme at all. After all, S. phonology wouldn't AFAIK allow anything like that.

Sindarin Grammar P34: Copula

(skipping another minor bridge entry)

https://academy.realelvish.net/2020/07/17/sindarin-grammar-p34-copula/
https://middangeard.org.uk/aglardh/node/504

In this post I'm proposing something new for a change, in particular specialized past and future copula ne- "was" and tho- "will be", so I'm curious what people think.


I think it's stating the obvious. The only objection I might have as for the copula per se: why long primitive vowel in tho, but short in ne?

An important point though: inn dha v'im is not a copular construction, this dha is the existential "to be".


Yes, that "dha" (whatever it is) seems to be "there is" like Q. eä- "to exist".


VT 44/22.

Dha seems to be an existential verb "to be". It cannot have a direct object

https://discord.com/channels/397489292185960468/478277939264225280/980464955792953395

@Lokyt Someone was asking about whether we have a way of saying "there is..." but was unsure of "dha", which made me revisit our past discussions on it. I saw something interesting. I was saying that it may be "na-" but force-lenited to be "dha" (like m>v, nasal to voiced fricative) due to the possible "eroded form" of the phrase "I have a mind to...". But looks like you thought that I was saying NA > NDA > S. (n)da-, and then reanalysis as simple da-. This actually makes more sense to me, though it was not what I had suggested. Still, the existential form of "dha" could mean that it should not be so closely related to na- which is not existential. But a Primitive variant as simple DA could be far enough in the past to diverge like that perhaps.

Well, at this point, anything is possible. But yes, given clear d... at the end of the first line of Ae Adar nín, it really looks like Tolkien had a verb with full-fledged d- in mind at certain moments

You mean at the beginning of the second line?

The end of the first line of the original (VT 44/23).

Given that inn dha v'im the only attested case of "there is" that we have in N./S. at all, I don't think there is much of a choice.
So indeed yes, it's what I'd recommend. Anything else would be a mere speculation.
