<p>
  Demonstrative pronouns are words like "this," "that," "these," and "those" that point to specific things or people, replacing nouns in a sentence. Demonstrative adjectives use the same words but modify nouns instead. In English they appear directly before the nouns ("this book", "those men"), and in Sindarin they appear after the nouns.
</p>
<p>
  In English the demonstrative object pronouns and demonstrative adjectives are the same, and most Neo-Sindarin writers assume this is also true of Sindarin.
</p>
<p>
  We have very little evidence of demonstrative pronouns in Sindarin, but the Moria inscription has two of them. A somewhat complete paradigm can be guessed based on those.
</p>
<p>
  Similarly to the paradigm used for dative personal pronouns, Fiona Jallings suggests using the preposition *an* as prefix for demonstrative datives. For more information on how these pronouns came to be, check <a href="https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-3676425227.html" target="_blank">Eldamo</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I think that's a good idea, but while Fiona and Paul Strack use §n{nasal mutation} when deriving these words, I think we should stick to §m{mixed mutation} instead. (This is why it looks different here.)
