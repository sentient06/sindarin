<p>
  Demonstrative pronouns are words like "this," "that," "these," and "those" that point to specific things or people, replacing nouns in a sentence. Demonstrative adjectives use the same words but modify nouns instead, appearing directly before them, such as in "this book" or "those cars."
</p>
<p>
  In English the demonstrative object pronouns and demonstrative adjectives are the same, and most Neo-Sindarin writers assume this is also true of Sindarin.
</p>
<p>
  We have very little evidence of demonstrative pronouns in Sindarin, but the Moria inscription has two of them. A somewhat complete paradigm can be guessed based on those.
