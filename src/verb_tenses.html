<p>
  In English, there are only two morphological tenses: present (non-past) and past tense. All the rest is formed with auxiliaries, and are not, strictly speaking, tense inflections. That dependency on auxiliaries is what is called a "periphrastic tense."
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, Sindarin only has three indicative tenses: past, present and future. Any other tenses in Sindarin have to be periphrastic, like English.
</p>
<h3>
  Continuous tenses
</h3>
<p>
  It's debatable whether continuous tenses can be achieved in Sindarin, because we don't have any evidence of it.
</p>
<p>
  Certain constructions can be made that emulate the behaviour of a number of European languages, like using past tense copula with present active participle, for example, to achieve what might be considered "past continuous." Example:
</p>
<pre>
  nîn hennol <span class="soft">barf</span>     ≈ "‹I was› reading [a] book"
  ni hennol <span class="soft">barf</span>      ≈ "I [am] reading [a] book"
  nathon hennol <span class="soft">barf</span>  ≈ "‹I will be› reading [a] book"
</pre>
<p>
  The argument here is that it translates almost seamlessly into English, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, and a number of other languages, and the translation looks a lot like past continuous, but we don't know whether this is a reliable way of expressing continuity or progression on its own.
</p>
<p>
  The chief intention of a continuous tense is to define or emphasise a temporal relationship between the main action taking place and another discrete event that happened during this action. This relationship can be expressed without grammatically bending the verbs into an unproven standard. For example:
</p>
<pre>
  lo hennen <span class="soft">barf</span>, lhassannen e·<span class="soft">'lim</span> lín = "while I read a book, I heard your voice"
  
  Literally:
  
  "while ‹I read› [a] book, ‹I heard› the·voice yours"
</pre>
<p>
  This is the preferred approach in Neo-Sindarin for past continuous. A future continuous can be expressed similarly:
</p>
<pre>
  lo hennathon <span class="soft">barf</span>, no dîn! = "while ‹I read› [a] book, be quiet!"
</pre>
<p>
  The present continuous is not a concern, because in Sindarin, the present tense can describe continuity on its own:
</p>
<pre>
  hennon <span class="soft">barf</span>, no dîn! = "‹I read› [a] book, be quiet!"
                       = "‹I am reading› [a] book, be quiet!"
</pre>
<p>
  Sindarin has no mechanisms for describing perfective, i.e. if an action has been completed or not. Context should describe it.
