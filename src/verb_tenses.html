  In English, there are only two morphological tenses: present (non-past) and past tense. All the rest is formed with auxiliaries, and are not, strictly speaking, tense inflections. That dependency on auxiliaries is what is called a "periphrastic tense."
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, Sindarin only has three indicative tenses: past, present and future. Any other tenses in Sindarin have to be periphrastic, like English.
</p>
<h4>
  Continuous tenses
</h4>
<p>
  It's debatable whether continuous tenses can be achieved in Sindarin, because we don't have any evidence of it.
</p>
<p>
  Certain constructions can be made that emulate the behaviour of a number of European languages, like using past tense copula with present active participle, for example, to achieve what might be considered "past continuous." Example:
</p>
<pre>
  nîn hennol <span class="soft">barf</span>     ≈ "‹I was› reading [a] book"
  ni hennol <span class="soft">barf</span>      ≈ "I [am] reading [a] book"
  nathon hennol <span class="soft">barf</span>  ≈ "‹I will be› reading [a] book"
</pre>
<p>
  The argument here is that it translates almost seamlessly into languages that support a <i>verbal periphrasis</i> style of past tense continuous, like English, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, some dialects of German, and others. That means they can achieve a sense of past continuous by using a past tense "to be" (or other auxiliaries) and a participle/gerund. From Sindarin, the translation looks a lot like past continuous in these languages, but we don't know whether this is a reliable way of expressing continuity or progression on its own, as there are also many languages that wouldn't support this kind of construction.
</p>
<p>
  The recommendation is to avoid that kind of construction.
</p>
<p>
  The chief intention of a continuous tense is to define or emphasise a temporal relationship between the main action taking place and another discrete event that happened during this action. This relationship can be expressed without grammatically bending the verbs into an unproven standard. For example:
</p>
<pre>
  lo hennen <span class="soft">barf</span>, lhassannen e·<span class="soft">'lim</span> lín = "while I read a book, I heard your voice"
  
  Literally:
  
  "while ‹I read› [a] book, ‹I heard› the·voice yours"
</pre>
<p>
  This is the preferred approach in Neo-Sindarin for past continuous. A future continuous can be expressed similarly:
</p>
<pre>
  lo hennathon <span class="soft">barf</span>, no dîn! = "while ‹I read› [a] book, be quiet!"
</pre>
<p>
  The present continuous is not a concern, because Sindarin is <i>aspectually underspecified</i>. That is, the present tense is used to express both ongoing and habitual actions, so it can describe continuity on its own.
</p>
<pre>
  hennon <span class="soft">barf</span> = "‹I read› [a] book" (habitual or general truth — imperfective aspect), or
  hennon <span class="soft">barf</span> = "‹I am reading› [a] book" (action occurring now — progressive aspect).
</pre>
<p>
  These can be disambiguated with prepositions, conjunctions and others.
</p>
<pre>
  hennon <span class="soft">barf</span> <b>hí</b> = "‹I am reading› [a] book <b>now</b>"
</pre>
<p>
  Sindarin has no mechanisms for describing perfective, i.e. if an action has been completed or not. Once again, context should describe it. A preposition, conjunction or other mechanism can help elucidate the message meant.
</p>
<pre>
  hennon <span class="soft">barf</span> <b>hí</b>     = "‹I am reading› [a] book <b>now</b>"
  <b>edílen</b> hennad <span class="soft">barf</span> = "<b>‹I've finished›</b> reading [a] book"
</pre>
