<h3>
  %section% Relative Pronouns
</h3>
<p>
  Attested forms of relative pronouns are scant: we have <b>i</b>, <b>ai</b>, and <b>ir</b>.
</p>
<p>
  Of these, the only one that seem consistent enough for use on Neo-Sindarin is <b>i</b>, which has the meaning of "that", "who(m)", "which."
</p>
<p>
  The other two are questionable. For example, <b>ir</b> had a Quenya equivalent <b>íre</b> that was replaced by <b>yá</b>. Everything else are, naturally, Neo-Sindarin reconstructions.
</p>

<h4>
  Restrictiveness
</h4>
<p>
  The relative clause in Sindarin sometimes causes §s{soft mutation} or §n{nasal mutation}, depending on plurality, and sometimes it doesn't. While the reason why that happens is unknown, the best hypothesis is because of **restrictiveness**.
</p>
<p>
  A restrictive relative clause gives essential information about the noun. Without it, the meaning changes. Example:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <span>
    The book <b>that recounts the tale</b> is thick.
  </span>
  <small>
    (We need the clause to know which book.)
  </small>
</blockquote>
<p>
  In the other hand, a non-restrictive relative clause adds extra, non-essential information. The sentence still makes sense without it. These clauses are usually set off with commas.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <span>
    The king, <b>who lives in Armenelos</b>, went to Lindon.
  </span>
  <small>
    (The clause just adds extra detail; we already know which king.)
  </small>
</blockquote>
<p>
  So, the **mutation** only occurs when the clause is a **restrictive** relative clause.
</p>
<p>
  And it should cause **no mutation** when it's a **non-restrictive** relative clause.
</p>
<p>
  Examples:
</p>
<pre>
  Restrictive singular (mutates):

  en·§s{barf|parf} **i** §s{drenar|trenar} e·§s{bent|pent} §s{dûg|tûg} = "the book **that** recounts the tale [is] thick"
  
  Restrictive plural (mutates):

  in·§n{pherf|perf} **i** §n{threnerir|trenerir} e·§s{bent|pent} §s{duig|tuig} = "the books **that** recount the tale [are] thick"

  Non-restrictive (no mutation):

  en·aran, **i** bâr §s{vi|mi} Armenelos, evin an Lindon = "the king, **who** lives in Armenelos, went to Lindon"
</pre>

<h5>
  Recommendation
</h5>
<p>
  To fill the gap in relative pronouns, it's suggested one use relative pronouns derived from <abbr title="Common Eldarin">CE</abbr> ✶ya with case endings, largely paralleling Quenya.
</p>
<p>
  Note that the primitive **y** yields an **i** in Sindarin. But that **i** doesn't behave as a vowel. In this case we parallel it to a **j** instead, and there's a class of pronouns known as "j-pronouns".
</p>
<p>
  <i>"The j-pronouns developed naturally into relatives. In this use the bare vocalic form **i** was most used in Eldarin; or else the bare vowels: **e** personal, **a** impersonal."</i> - PE23/114
</p>
<p>
  Based on Quenya, the following pronouns can be deduced:
</p>
<pre>
  Subject/object relative: <b>i</b>

  When ...:  **io** ⪤ Q. yá
  Where ..: **ias** ⪤ Q. yasse
  Whence .: **ias**
  Whither : **ias** or...
  Whither : **ian** ~ Q. yanna
  How ....: **ial** ~ Q. yalle
  To whom : **ian** (dative)
</pre>
<p>
  Examples:
</p>
<pre>
  Which:
  sad <b>i</b> aen nî belt = "[a] place which should be strong"

  When:
  <b>io</b> Ardhon §s{bân|pân} aw îdh = "when [the] World all had peace"

  Where:
  Sarn Athrad, <b>ias</b> oeth §s{chídas|hídas} ab = "Sarn Athrad, where battle after happened"

  Whence:
  in·Edhil istasser <b>ias</b> te odul = "The elves knew whence he came"

  Whither:
  in·Edhil istasser <b>ias</b> te evin = "The elves knew whither he went"
  in·Edhil istasser <b>ian</b> te evin = "The elves knew whither he went"

  How:
  Thingol §s{'erias|gerias} o <b>ial</b> adabatha anim §s{mbâr|bâr} = "Thingol pondered about how ‹he will build› [him]self [a] dwelling"

  To whom:
  Thingol, **ian** i·Naugrim agórer §s{Venegroth|Menegroth} = "Thingol, **‹to whom›** the Dwarves made Menegroth"
</pre>
