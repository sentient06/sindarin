  %section% Relative Pronouns
</h3>
<p>
  Attested forms of relative pronouns are scant: we have <b>i</b>, <b>ai</b>, and <b>ir</b>.
</p>
<p>
  Of these, the only one that seem consistent enough for use on Neo-Sindarin is <b>i</b>, which has the meaning of "that", "who(m)", "which."
</p>
<p>
  The other two are questionable. For example, <b>ir</b> had a Quenya equivalent <b>íre</b> that was replaced by <b>yá</b>. Everything else are, naturally, Neo-Sindarin reconstructions.
</p>

<h4>
  Restrictiveness
</h4>
<p>
  The relative clause in Sindarin sometimes causes mutation, and sometimes it doesn't. While the reason why that happens is unknown, the best hypothesis is because of restrictiveness.
</p>
<p>
  A restrictive relative clause gives essential information about the noun. Without it, the meaning changes. Example:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <span>
    The book <b>that recounts the tale</b> is thick.
  </span>
  <small>
    (We need the clause to know which book.)
  </small>
</blockquote>
<p>
  In the other hand, a non-restrictive relative clause adds extra, non-essential information. The sentence still makes sense without it. These clauses are usually set off with commas.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <span>
    The king, <b>who lives in Armenelos</b>, went to Lindon.
  </span>
  <small>
    (The clause just adds extra detail; we already know which king.)
  </small>
</blockquote>
<p>
  The relative clause would cause <span class="nasal"><b>nasal mutation</b></span> only when followed by a <b>restrictive relative clause</b>.
</p>
<p>
  And it should cause <b>no mutation</b> when followed by a <b>non-restrictive relative clause</b>.
</p>
<p>
  Examples:
</p>
<pre>
  Restrictive:

  en·<span class="soft">barf</span> <b>i</b> <span class="nasal">threnar</span> e·<span class="soft">bent</span> <span class="soft">dûg</span> = "the book <b>that</b> recounts the tale is thick"

  Non-restrictive:

  en·aran, <b>i</b> bâr <span class="soft">vi</span> Armenelos, evin an Lindon = "the king, <b>who</b> lives in Armenelos, went to Lindon"
</pre>

<p>
  To fill the gap in relative pronouns, it's suggested one use relative pronouns derived from <abbr title="Common Eldarin">CE</abbr> ✶ya with case endings, largely paralleling Quenya.
</p>
<p>
  Note that the primitive "y" yields an "i" in Sindarin. But that "i" doesn't behave as a vowel. In this case we parallel it to a "j" instead, and there's a class of pronouns known as "j-pronouns".
</p>
<p>
  <i>"The j-pronouns developed naturally into relatives. In this use the bare vocalic form [i] was most used in Eldarin; or else the bare vowels: [e] personal, [a] impersonal."</i> - PE23/114
</p>
<p>
  Based on Quenya, the following pronouns can be deduced:
</p>
<pre>
  Subject/object relative: <b>i</b>

  When:     <b>io</b> ⪤ Q. yá

  Where:   <b>ias</b> ⪤ Q. yasse
  Whence:  <b>ias</b>

  Whither: <b>ias</b> or...
  Whither: <b>ian</b> ~ Q. yanna

  How:     <b>ial</b> ~ Q. yalle

  To whom  <b>ian</b> (dative)
</pre>
<p>
  Examples:
</p>
<pre>
  Which:
  sad <b>i</b> aen nî belt = "[a] place which should be strong"

  When:
  <b>io</b> Ardhon <span class="soft">phain</span> aw îdh = "when [the] World all had peace"

  Where:
  Sarn Athrad, <b>ias</b> oeth <span class="soft">chídas</span> ab = "Sarn Athrad, where battle after happened"

  Whence:
  in·Edhil istasser <b>ias</b> te odul = "The elves knew whence he came"

  Whither:
  in·Edhil istasser <b>ias</b> te evin = "The elves knew whither he went"
  in·Edhil istasser <b>ian</b> te evin = "The elves knew whither he went"

  How:
  Thingol <span class="soft">'erias</span> o <b>ial</b> adabatha anim <span class="soft">mbâr</span> = "Thingol pondered about how ‹he will build› [him]self [a] dwelling"

  To whom:
  Thingol, <b>ian</b> i·Naugrim agórer Venegroth = "Thingol, to whom the Dwarves made Menegroth"
</pre>
