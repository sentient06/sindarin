<p>
  Sindarin has five basic sets of pronouns: independent, subject, object, dative and possessive:
</p>
<pre>
                     **Independent     Subject          Object         Dative             Possessive**

  Independent and subject pronouns were already explained earlier in this page.

<h4>
  Handling ambiguity with independent pronouns

<p>
  Independent pronouns do what it says on the tin: they are independent words that precede the verb. They are not used in Sindarin unless strictly necessary.
</p>
<p>
  There is no grammatical gender in Sindarin, so the third person singular can be ambiguous. The problem has to be solved the same way a language like Finnish handles it. Example:
</p>
<pre>
  Thingol looked at her. <b>She</b> spoke no word.
</pre>
<p>
  That would be translated to:
</p>
<pre>
  Thingol egin na §s{den|ten}. **Te** úagarfant û §s{beth|peth}.
</pre>
<p>
  In this example, **te** can mean both Thingol or the woman he looked at. In the story we know by context the woman is Melian, but the second sentence is still ambiguous. To fix it the subject needs to be explicit:
</p>
<pre>
  Thingol egin na §s{den|ten}. **Melian** úagarfant û §s{beth|peth}. = "Thingol looked at her. **Melian** spoke no word."
</pre>
<h4>
  Subject pronouns
</h4>
<p>
  The subject form is a suffix used with verbs that do not have an explicit noun as a subject.
</p>
<p>
  The (o) in the pronoun list above indicates that derived verbs change their final **a** to **o** as in:
</p>
<pre>
  en·adan ann**a** = "the man gives"
               vs
         ann**on** = "I give"
</pre>

<h4>
  Object pronouns
</h4>
<p>
  The object forms are most often used for direct objects of verbs. That means it goes through the usual §s{soft mutation}.
</p>
<p>
  Object pronouns are also known as **oblique pronouns**.
</p>
<p>
  They are also used as the object of prepositions and imperatives.
</p>
<pre>
  Lúthien mabent **§s{din|tin}**  = "Lúthien asked **them**" (tin)
  Thingol egin **na** **§s{den|ten}** = "Thingol looked at **him/her/it**" (ten)
  dambedo **nin**!        = "Answer **me**"
</pre>

<h4>
  Dative pronouns
</h4>
<p>
  Sindarin has a few attested words that play the role of dative pronouns. They are the preposition **an** + the object pronoun, which goes through §m{mixed mutation}. The reflexive pronoun is also used.
</p>
<pre>
  ón **annin**                      "‹he gave› **to me**"
  guren §s{bêd|pêd} **annin**               "‹my heart› tells **[to] me**"
  annon edhellen, edro hi **ammen** "elvish gate, open now **for us**"
  ú-§s{chebin|hebin} estel **anim**           "I have kept no hope **for myself**"
</pre>
<p>
  <small>
    You may notice that the dative pronouns have collisions. For example, *anden* can mean "to him/her/it" and "to you" (plural). That is acceptable and disambiguated by context. It's common for languages to have collisions in pronouns. Check, for example, English *you*, German *sie*/*Sie* and Italian *lei*.
