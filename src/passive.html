  %section% Passive voice

<p>
  Sindarin does not have a dedicated passive verb form, unlike Quenya. Instead, two strategies appear in Tolkien's writings:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using 3rd person plural</li>
  <li>Using passive participle predicatively</li>
</ul>
<h4>
  3rd person plural
</h4>
<p>
  The 3rd person is used for impersonal verbs the same way it's used for passive voice.
</p>
<p>
  This impersonal verbs mechanic is used in Romance languages because of "implied subject". For example, in Portuguese the word <i>chove</i> means "it's raining", and it's simply the verb <i>chover</i> "to rain" in the third person, with no subject.
</p>
<p>
  The same logic applies in Sindarin: <i>uil</i> = "[it] rains".
</p>
<p>
  Sindarin goes one step further and makes use of the third person to create a passive voice:
</p>
<pre>
  te sennui Panthael <b>estathar</b> aen = "he should be called Fullwise"
                             (lit.) "he rather Fullwise <b>‹they will call›</b> should"
</pre>
<p>
  This can be a rather confusing example, but here's another:
</p>
<pre>
  <b>golthathar</b> den aen = "he should be taught" <small> = (lit.) "<b>‹they will teach›</b> him should"</small>
</pre>

<h4>
  Passive participle

  This has been sparsely attested, but Tolkien did analyse <i>mae govannen</i> as meaning "well met" with govannen functioning as a passive participle. From this, many Neo-Sindarin writers assume the structure:
</p>
<pre>
  en·adan §s{dhangen|dangen} = "the man (is) slain"
</pre>
<p>
  Applying Paul Strack's past and future copula, this can be used for past and future passive voice:
</p>
<pre>
  en·adan nî §s{dhangen|dangen}    = "the man was slain"
  en·adan tho §s{dhangen|dangen}   = "the man will be slain"
  en·adan natho §s{dhangen|dangen} = "the man will be slain" (alt.)
</pre>
