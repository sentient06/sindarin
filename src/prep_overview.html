<p>
  In Sindarin, when a preposition is used adverbially and follows immediately after the verb, it undergoes <span class="soft">soft mutation</span>.
</p>
<!-- https://discord.com/channels/397489292185960468/1397156220845949069/1397961754159616215 -->
<p>
  All prepositions that end in a vowel cause soft mutation.
</p>
<p>
  Most that end in a consonant also cause soft mutation, but some prepositions that ended in a consonant back in Common Eldarin cause different mutations.
</p>
<p>
  Prepositions are generally <abbr title="A monosyllabic word having no stress or accent and pronounced as a prefix of the following word">proclitic</abbr>, so e.g. <b>mîn</b> and <b>trî</b> and <b>mîg</b> can be shortened.
</p>

<h3>
  Definite prepositional forms
</h3>
<p>
  Prepositions typically deal with indefinite objects. For example, "mi <span class="soft">ham</span>" translates to "in <b>a</b> room". To mark the room as a particular room, the preposition (mi) requires an article.
</p>
<p>
  In both the singular and the plural, the article may appear as a suffix appended to prepositions. This suffix normally has the form <b>-n</b> or <b>-in</b>, but it might look a bit different depending on phonetic rules.
</p>

<h3>
  N(a) vs na(n)
</h3>
<p>
  There are two prepositions that can cause ambiguity as both can be written as <i>na</i>. We distinguish them by how they behave when succeeded by an object starting on a vowel.
</p>
<h4>N(a)</h4>
<p>
  <b>n(a)</b> is an allative preposition, indicating movement towards something. It is regularly elided to <b>n'</b> before vowels and it triggers <span class="soft">soft mutation</span>.
</p>
<p>
  Avoid using <b>n(a)</b> for meanings of time, unless it's to indicate the end of a waiting period, as in <i>na vedui</i>, "at last".
</p>
<p>
  This preposition should <b>not</b> be reduced before a "lost g."
</p>
<p>
  Examples
</p>
<pre>
  Thingol allu adhul <b>na</b> <span class="soft">Dhor</span>-Rodyn = "Thingol never returned <b>to</b> Valinor"
  athar <span class="soft">dhoer</span> lend <b>n'</b>Eriador       = "beyond leagues wide <b>of</b> Eriador"
  <b>na</b> <span class="soft">'aladh</span>                        = "<b>towards</b> [a] tree"
</pre>

<h4>Na(n)</h4>
<p>
  <b>na(n)</b> is a prepositional genitive, used for partitive relationships. It becomes <b>nan</b> before vowels and triggers <span class="nasal">nasal mutation</span>.
</p>
<p>
  It indicates a sense of possession or having a certain feature.
</p>
<p>
  Example
</p>
<pre>
  Melian <span class="soft">Vaea</span>, <b>na</b> nûr i<span class="nasal">dh·Rodyn</span> = "Melian was a Maia, <b>of</b> the Valar-kind"
  E·<span class="soft">chên</span> ereb <b>nan</b> Aragorn       = "The only child <b>of</b> Aragorn"
</pre>

<h3>
  The three o prepositions (about / away from / origin)
</h3>
<div class="image right">
  <img src="prepositions-o.jpg" alt="Three look-alike prepositions (meme)">
</div>
<p>
  There are three different prepositions that have partially coalesced into <b>o</b>:
</p>
<ol class="alpha">
  <li><b>o</b> meaning "about"</li>
  <li><b>o</b> meaning "away from" as a movement - away from / due to / from someone or something as a point of departure - has an ablative function</li>
  <li><b>o</b> meaning "from" as origin - from inside / out of / originating in - is used for the genitive of origin</li>
</ol>
<p>
  This o/od/ui tripartite set is not interchangeable! They mean vastly different things and should be dealt with carefully.
</p>

<h4>
  "About"
</h4>
<p>
  The easiest one to discern from the others is the first, meaning "about".
</p>
<p>
  Before vowels, this <b>o</b> becomes <b>oh</b> and before consonants, it uses the <span class="sibilant">sibilant mutation</span>. It doesn't change with a definite article.
</p>
<p>
  Before a word starting with an s-, it becomes <b>os</b>. Examples:
</p>
<pre>
   <b>o</b> <span class="sibilant">lhoss</span>       = "<b>about</b> snow", or "<b>concerning</b> snow" (snow = "loss")
   <b>oh</b> Edhil      = "<b>about</b> Elves", or "<b>concerning</b> Elves"
   <b>os</b> sîr        = "<b>about</b> rivers", or "<b>concerning</b> rivers"
   <b>oh</b> i·silevril = "<b>about</b> the silmarils", or "<b>concerning</b> the silmarils"
</pre>

<h4>
  "Away from"
</h4>
<p>
  The second <b>o</b> is an ablative function. Ablative is used to indicate motion away from something.
</p>
<p>
  This preposition causes stop mutation. The definite version of it morphs into <b>od</b>.
</p>
<p>
  This preposition can be compared to Russian от (ot). It typically means movement or relation away from a point. It implies distance or separation, often from a person, object, or source of influence. Examples:
</p>
<pre>
  Meno <b>o</b> nin!     = "Go <b>[away] from</b> me!"
  Ann <b>o</b> mellon    = "[A] gift <b>from</b> [a] friend" (source/person)
  Naeg <b>od</b> e·<span class="soft">dhram</span> = "Pain <b>from</b> the blow" (cause)
</pre>

<h4>
  "From" (origin)
</h4>
<p>
  The last <b>o</b> is used for a genitive function of origin.
</p>
<p>
  This preposition causes soft mutation. The definite version of it morphs into <b>uin</b> as it absorbs the article.
</p>
<p>
  This preposition can be compared to Russian из (iz). It implies that the subject starts inside a place or situation and moves outward. Examples:
</p>
<pre>
  Arwen <b>o</b> Imladris = "Arwen is <b>from</b> Rivendell" (originating from within the place)
  Te anu <b>ui</b> <span class="soft">vâr</span>    = "He went <b>from</b> the house" ("he left the house") ("house" = bâr) *
  Echannen <b>o</b> daw   = "Made <b>from</b> wood" (the material out of which something is made) ("wood" = taw)
</pre>
<small>
  * anu is past tense 3rd person of gwae- "to go, depart"
</small>

<h3>
  Na(n) vs mo
</h3>
na(n) = "(partitive) of; with, accompanied/provided by, associated/marked with"
mo = "by (agent of), with"

    Re: nan vs. mo - I don't agree with using mo for "filled with trees".
    My understanding of mo, based on its etymology and gloss, is that it is an element introducing an agent.
    So mo here would be used to clarify by whom "it was filled with trees", not what it was filled with.
    I am not entirely convinced nan is corrected either, but IMO it certainly shouldn't be mo.

<!--
Russian distinguishes between из (iz) and от (ot) — both often translated as from in English, but their usage depends on the spatial or conceptual relationship between entities.

1. из (iz) – “from inside / out of / originating in”

Core meaning: movement out of or from within something enclosed or bounded.
It implies that the subject starts inside a place or situation and moves outward.

Examples:

Я из России — “I am from Russia” (originating from within the country)

Он вышел из дома — “He came out of the house”

Сделано из дерева — “Made from wood” (the material out of which something is made)

Metaphorically: из often marks origin, source, or material composition.

2. от (ot) – “away from / due to / from someone or something as a point of departure”

Core meaning: movement or relation away from a point, not necessarily enclosed. It implies distance or separation, often from a person, object, or source of influence.

Examples:

Отойди от меня! — “Get away from me!”

Подарок от друга — “A gift from a friend” (source/person)

Боль от удара — “Pain from the blow” (cause)

Metaphorically: от expresses separation, cause, or origin in a looser, external sense.
