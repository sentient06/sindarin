The following is theoretical and not confirmed:

Prepositions didn't mutate their objects, considering "vi Menel" as well.

<p>
  Prepositions are parts of speech that show relationships between words in a sentence.
</p>
<p>
  They often indicate where, when, why, or how something happens.
</p>
<p>
  In Sindarin, when a preposition is used adverbially and follows immediately after a verb or the zero copula, it undergoes §soft mutation§.

<p>
  All prepositions that end in a vowel cause soft mutation.
</p>
<p>
  Most that end in a consonant also cause soft mutation, but some prepositions that ended in a consonant back in Common Eldarin cause different mutations.

<p>
  Prepositions are generally <abbr title="A monosyllabic word having no stress or accent and pronounced as a prefix of the following word">proclitic</abbr>, so e.g. <b>mîn</b> and <b>trî</b> and <b>mîg</b> can be shortened.
</p>

<h4>
  Definite prepositional forms
</h4>
<p>
  Prepositions typically deal with indefinite objects. For example, "mi <span class="soft">ham</span>" translates to "in <b>a</b> room". To mark the room as a particular room, the preposition (mi) requires an article.
</p>
<p>
  In both the singular and the plural, the article may appear as a suffix appended to prepositions. This suffix normally has the form <b>-n</b> or <b>-in</b>, but it might look a bit different depending on phonetic rules.
