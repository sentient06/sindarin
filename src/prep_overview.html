  Prepositions are generally <abbr title="A monosyllabic word having no stress or accent and pronounced as a prefix of the following word">proclitic</abbr>, so e.g. <b>mîn</b> and <b>trî</b> and <b>mîg</b> can be shortened.
</p>
<p>
  In both the singular and the plural, the definite article may appear as a suffix appended to prepositions in the forms <b>-n</b> and <b>-in</b>.
