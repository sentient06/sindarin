<p>
  Diminutive is Sindarin is not very well documented, so this is rather speculative.
</p>
<p>
  Diminutives are probably caused with the suffix <b>-eg</b> (from < ✶-ikā, attested in PE23.)
</p>
<p>
  That works along with the distribution of <b>-ig</b> (< ✶iki, comparable to Q. -ince). There's another suffix <b>-og</b> of unknown etymology, which may represent a single unit of something. This one is unclear, but it is highly unlikely to be random.

  Examples:
</p>
<pre>
  atheg    = "little father; thumb"
  emig     = "little mother, mum"
  gwinig   = "little-one, baby"
  honeg    = "little brother"
  lebig    = "little finger"
  nethig   = "little sister, little girl"
  Nogotheg = "Dwarflet"
  toleg    = "sticker-up (middle finger)"
  lotheg   = "single (little) flower"
</pre>
<!-- 'nín' can't form a diminutive, it expresses a genitive relation. -->
