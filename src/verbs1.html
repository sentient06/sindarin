<p>
  Sindarin verbs are inflected for tense, number and person.
</p>
<p>
  On <abbr title="Parma Eldalamberon 23">PE23</abbr>, there is an explicit statement saying that verbs should be <span class="soft">lenited</span> after the subject, which seem at odds with many attested forms. The current working hypothesis is that the lenition does not apply after complex subjects. So if the subject is composed by multiple words (e.g. <i>Celebrimbor o Eregion</i>) the following verb is not <span class="soft">lenited</span>. Otherwise, it apparently is.
</p>
<p>
  There are two major classes of verbs: Basic and derived.
</p>

<h4>
  Basic (i-stem)
</h4>
<p>
  They are based on an unadorned primitive verbal root. They are also known as i-stem (because in the infinitive they have an -i added to them.)
</p>
<p>
  Basic verbs are usually represented by stems ending in a consonant as in: ped- "to say, speak".
</p>
<p>
  Monosyllabic basic verbs are lengthened: câr "do, make" (car-).
</p>
<p>
  Then pronominal suffixes are added, the ancient aorist suffix i is preserved, which causes internal i-affection of the base vowel: cerin "I do" (car-). For many basic verbs, the vowel becomes e in an inflected present tense.
</p>
<pre>
  car-: present tense cerin "I do".
  heb-: present tense hebin "I keep".
  tol-: present tense telin "I come".
</pre>
<p>
  Because of the large number of collisions in the present tense, basic verbs are less likely to survive, and that's why we see derived verbs or prefixed verbs in Sindarin where their Quenya equivalents are basic verbs.
</p>
<pre>
  S. cova-   "assemble"    vs.  Q. ócom-
  S. díhena- "forgive"     vs.  Q. apsen-
  S. echad-  "shape out"   vs.  Q. cat-
  S. groga-  "feel terror" vs.  Q. ruc-
  S. hadhwa- "sea"         vs.  Q. har-
  N. nara-   "tell"        vs. ᴹQ. nyar-
  N. taetha- "fasten"      vs. ᴹQ. tak-
  N. teitha- "write"       vs. ᴹQ. tek-
  N. telia-  "play"        vs. ᴹQ. tyal-
  N. toba-   "cover"       vs. ᴹQ. top-
</pre>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  car- (to do)

  1st person - cerin    - I do
  2nd person - cerig    - thou dost
  2nd person - ceril    - thou dost (polite)
  2nd person - ceridh   - thou dost (archaic polite)
  3rd person - câr      - he/she does

  1st person - cerif    - we (not you) do
  1st person - cerib    - we (and you) do
  2nd person - cerigir  - you do
  2nd person - ceridhir - you do
  3rd person - cerir    - they do
</pre>

<h4>
  Derived (a-stem)
</h4>
<p>
  They are produced with some kind of verbal suffix. They are also known as a-stem.
</p>
<p>
  Derived verbs generally appear with stems ending in a as in: <i>teitha-</i> "to write".
</p>
<p>
  The infinitive is formed with the ending <b>-d</b>:

<pre>
  brenia- "endure" > breniad "to endure"
</pre>
<p>
  The 3rd person singular present tense is identical to the unadorned verb stem itself:
</p>
<pre>
  brenia- "endure" > brenia "endures, is enduring"
</pre>
<p>
  Pronominal suffixes make the final a of the verb change to o as in <i>galon</i> "I grow" (<i>gala-</i>).
</p>
<pre>
  breniar "(they) endure"
  breniab "we endure"
</pre>
<p>
  The ending -n for "I" causes the final -a to become -o instead:
</p>
<pre>
  brenion "I endure",
  dagron "I make war"
</pre>

<p>
  Example
</p>
<pre>
  gala- (to grow)

  1st person - galon    - I grow
  2nd person - galog    - thou growest
  2nd person - galol    - thou growest (polite)
  2nd person - galodh   - thou growest (archaic polite)
  3rd person - gala     - he/she grows

  1st person - galof    - we (not you) grow
  1st person - galob    - we (and you) grow
  2nd person - galogir  - you grow
  2nd person - galodhir - you grow
  3rd person - galar    - they grow
</pre>

<h4>
  Verbal nouns (gerund)
</h4>

<p>
  Verbal nouns function as both gerunds and infinitives, and behave in all respects like nouns except:
</p>
<ol class="alpha">
  <li>they cannot be inflected in the plural and</li>
  <li>are not mutated when functioning as the infinitival object of another verb.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Basic verbs:
  add -ed
</p>
<pre>
  car- (to do) = cared (doing)
</pre>
<p>
Derived verbs ending in -a:
  add -d
</p>
<pre>
  saeda- (to teach) = saedad (teaching)
</pre>
<p>
  It works as an object to another verb, like English infinitive.
  E.g.
</p>
<pre>
  nidhin <b>mened</b> "I intend to go"
  melin <b>saedad</b> "I love to teach"
</pre>

<p>
  A verbal noun does not undergo soft mutation.
</p>
<p>
  A verbal noun may follow a verb, but an adverb may be in the middle as well.
  E.g.
</p>
<pre>
  te aníra ennas <b>suilannad</b> "he desires there ‹to greet›" (ennas = there)
</pre>

<p>
  The gerund/infinitive itself can take a direct object, which DOES undergo the usual soft mutation.
  E.g.
</p>
<pre>
  aníra suilannad <b>mhellyn</b> "‹he desires› ‹to greet› friends" (mhellyn is mutated from "mellyn")
</pre>
