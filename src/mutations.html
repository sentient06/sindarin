<p>
  Tolkien attempted to make languages that sound beautiful. Sindarin has mechanisms in place to prevent hiatuses and harsh consonantal encounters. That's why many of the words in Sindarin change sounds when spoken in a certain sequence.
</p>
<p>
  Consonant mutations are where the ends and beginings of words interact. Mutations are closely related to Sindarin's phonetic history. These mutations are so frequent, in fact, that it is probably the most pertinent property of Sindarin for any enthusiasts.
</p>
<p>
  Sindarin has about six types of consonant mutations. The three most important ones are: <span class="soft">soft mutation</span>, <span class="nasal">nasal mutation</span>, and <span class="mixed">mixed mutation</span>. They are more common and widely used.
</p>
<p>
  The other three are limited in scope, normally dealing with a few prepositions each. They are the <span class="stop">stop mutation</span>, the <span class="liquid">liquid mutation</span>, and the <span class="sibilant">sibilant mutation</span>.
</p>
<p>
  These consonant mutations apply to the initial consonant of a word, either when closely following another word or in compounds.
</p>

<p>
  This is a summary of all the consonant mutations used in Neo-Sindarin:
</p>

<small class="note">**hw-** was the usual Neo-S orthography used before <abbr title="Parma Eldalamberon 23">PE23</abbr> - Eldamo changed it to **wh-** after <abbr title="Parma Eldalamberon 23">PE23</abbr>, since it became clear that JRRT used **wh-** more often. I'll follow the same pattern here.</small>

<h4>
  Soft mutation
</h4>
<p>
  <span class="soft">Soft mutation</span> - aka <span class="soft">lenition</span> - aka <span class="soft">vocalic mutation</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class="soft">Soft mutation</span> is a systematic lenition (sound-softening process) of initial consonants triggered by certain grammatical environments, such as following the definite article or appearing in compounds.
</p>
<p>
  It "softens" the consonant's articulation without changing its place of articulation, producing predictable alternations used to mark grammatical relationships.

<summary>
  Collisions between m- and b-
</summary>
<p>
  Please note that <b>m-</b> and <b>b-</b> both mutate into <b>v-</b>.
</p>
<p>
  This is known as inflectional syncretism. So, for example, *en·roch §s{vain}* can mean both "the beautiful horse" and "the chief horse", because both *bain* (beautiful) and *main* (chief) mutate to *§s{vain}*.
</p>
<p>
  In <abbr title="Parma Eldalamberon 23">PE23</abbr> Tolkien suggested that this mutation shouldn't occur for <b>m-</b> words to avoid creating collisions.
</p>
<p>
  However, I've made a check and found only 9 collisions (most Neo-Sindarin) that can be avoided by context and use of synonyms, which are listed bellow:
</p>
<pre>
  - bain (adj.) "beautiful; good, wholesome, favourable
  ↔ main (adj.) "prime, chief, pre-eminent"

  - balt (n.) "force, [ᴱN.] might"
  ↔ malt (n.) "gold (as metal)"

  - bang (n.) "staff"
  ↔ mang (n.) "butter"

  - both (n.) "fen, marsh; [N.] puddle, small pool"
  ↔ moth (n.) "dusk"

  - bâd (n.) "road, [N.] beaten track, pathway"
  ↔ mâd (n.) "meal"

  - bân (adj.) "fair, good, wholesome, favourable" (see bain)
  ↔ mân (n.) "departed spirit"

  - bíleb (adj.) "equal"
  ↔ míleb (adj.) "romantic"

  - bîl (n.) "likeness, similarity"
  ↔ mîl (n.) "love, affection"

  - bôr (n.) "heat"
  ↔ môr (n.) "dark(ness)"
</pre>
<p>
  And here are some near-misses, which are actually **mb-** words (which means that the lenited **b-** words look like the unmutated **m-** words):
</p>
<pre>
  - baul (n.) "torment" → [mb-]
  ↔ maul (n.) "flour"

  - baur (n.) "need" → [mb-]
  ↔ maur (n.) "gloom"

  - bund (n.) "snout, nose; cape [of land]" → [mb-]
  ↔ mund (n.) "bull"
</pre>
<p>
  I'd say that the worst offenders are *bain/main*, *bíleb/míleb* and *bôr/môr*. If context can't help with any of those, here are some alternative words:
</p>
<pre>
  bain  ~ dail
  bíleb ~ ain
  môr   ~ fuin
  moth  ~ uial
</pre>
<p>
  If precision is of the utmost importance, replacements can't be used for some reason, and ambiguity is inevitable, simply don't mutate the offending word.
</p>

<h4>
  Nasal mutation
</h4>
<p>
  The <span class="nasal">nasal mutation</span> is triggered by a preceding <b>n</b> (most often from the plural article <b>in</b> or prepositions like <b>na(n)</b>). It "nasalises" the initial consonant, producing these core effects:
</p>
<div class="wrapper pre">
<div class="b30">
    p  → ph     cl → chl    b  → m
    t  → th     c  → chr    d  → n
    c  → ch     tr → thr    g  → ng
                pr → phr
</div>
<div class="b30">
    dr → n-dr   br → mr    (n)d → nd
    gr → n-gr   bl → ml    (m)b → mb
    gl → n-gl              (n)g → ng
    gw → n-gw
</div>
<div class="b30">
    lh → l      h  → ch
    rh → r      hw → chw
    rn → rdh (n becomes dh if preceded by r)

    f, l, m, r, s and th remain unchanged
</div>
</div>
<p>
  The preceding nasal itself often drops before the mutated consonant, except before vowels, resistant clusters, and before other nasals (especially with <b>an</b>).
</p>
<!-- (Salo, 75-76) -->

<h4>
  Mixed mutation
</h4>
<p>
  There are actually two versions of the §m{mixed mutation}. The original one was proposed by David Salo as a special pattern — mainly used after a genitive preposition **en** "of" — that begins like §s{soft mutation} but then applies §n{nasal} effects once the lost historical vowel disappears, producing a more conservative outcome for b/d/g/m and fully restoring ancient mb/nd/ng.
</p>
<p>
  That version has been supplanted by <abbr title="Parma Eldalamberon 23">PE23</abbr>/141, in which Tolkien describes what seems to be a lenition with nasal assimilation:
</p>
<blockquote>
  "(...) but this before consonants would have produced S en followed by vocalic mutation and assimilation of *n*. So *en(a) parth*, the garden, &gt; *em-barth*. The nasal would probably have been lost before spirants, so *inā þoronō*, the eagle, &gt; *en(a) þóron* &gt; *e-þoron*."
</blockquote>
<p>
  The original Salo mutation is unlikely to be used in modern Neo-Sindarin **en** because the paradigm of the genitive has changed due to <abbr title="Parma Eldalamberon 23">PE23</abbr> and the <abbr title="Common Eldarin Article">CEA</abbr> (meaning that **en** is not a preposition, only an article.)
</p>
<p>
  The newer form of this mutation is used for a few prepositions, mainly **an** and the definite form of **mi**.
</p>
<p>
  This is the version described here.

<h4>
  Stop mutation
</h4>
<p>
  <span class="stop">Stop mutation</span> - aka <span class="stop">hard mutation</span>
</p>
<p>
  The <span class="stop">stop mutation</span> is a rare Sindarin mutation triggered by prepositions that historically ended in -t or -d (notably **ed** "out of" and **o** "from"). The ancient stop vanishes before the following consonant, producing these effects:
</p>
<div class="wrapper pre">
<div class="b30">
   p → ph   [n]d → nd      lh → l
   t → th   [m]b → mb      rh → r
   c → ch   [n]g → n-g
</div>
<div class="b70">
  h  → ch
  hw → chw
</div>
<div class="b100">
  b, d, f, g, l, m, n, r, s and th remain the same
  final preposition **ed** before s, f, th becomes es, ef, eth.
</div>
</div>
<p>
  The preposition's final t/d usually disappears, except before liquids (l, r, 'l, 'r, 'w) where it may survive. <span class="stop">Stop mutation</span> is attested only in theoretical notes and is considered optional in Neo-Sindarin.
</p>

<h4>
  Liquid mutation
</h4>
<p>
  The <span class="liquid">liquid mutation</span> is a speculative and probably archaic Sindarin mutation triggered by a preceding l or r. It is attested only in a couple of "Túrin Wrapper" sentences and seems not to operate in later Sindarin.
</p>
<p>
  Because most evidence elsewhere shows no such mutation after liquids, it is treated as an optional/archaic system in Neo-Sindarin.
</p>
<div class="wrapper pre">
<div class="b30">
  p → ph      b → v      [m]b → b
  t → th      d → dh     [n]d → d
  c → ch      g → '      [n]g → g
</div>
<div class="b70">
  hw → 'w     h → ch
  lh → 'l     m → v
  rh → 'r
</div>
</div>

<h4>
  Sibilant mutation
</h4>
<p>
  The <span class="sibilant">sibilant mutation</span> results from an ancient preceding s that caused various mutation effects before being lost.
</p>
<p>
  The two best examples of sibilant mutation are the preposition <b>o</b> "about" and the conjunction <b>a</b> "and".
</p>
<p>
  This mutation has two effects: First, the <b>h</b> which is the normal medial development of <b>s</b> reappears before vowels:
</p>
<pre>
  a<span class="sibilant">h annon</span> or a <span class="sibilant">hannon</span> = "and a gate"
  Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth = "The Debate of Finrod and Andreth"
</pre>
<p>
  The other effect is that the voiceless stops become voiceless spirants (p, t, c → ph, th, ch) and voiced liquids l, r become voiceless lh, rh, where these are the normal phonetic effect of a historical s preceding p, t, c; l, r.
</p>
<p>
  Though not mentioned by Tolkien, it is likely that older initial ch would be preserved rather than becoming h as it does initially, so that initial h would "mutate" to ch. 
</p>
<div class="wrapper pre">
<div class="b30">
  Initial voiceless stops become voiceless spirants:

  p → ph
  t → th
  c → ch

  Older initial ch is preserved:
  h → ch
</div>
<div class="b30">
  Voiced liquids become voiceless (possibly archaic):

  l → lh
  r → rh
</div>
<div class="b30">
  b, d, g, [m]b, [n]d, [n]g, s, wh, lh, rh, and m remain the same.
</div>
</div>
<p>
  It is an obscure but plausible mutation for a(h).
