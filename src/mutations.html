  Tolkien attempted to make languages that sound beautiful. Sindarin has mechanisms in place to prevent hiatuses and harsh consonantal encounters. That's why many of the words in Sindarin change sounds when spoken in a certain sequence.
</p>
<p>
  Consonant mutations are where the ends and beginings of words interact. Mutations are closely related to Sindarin's phonetic history. These mutations are so frequent, in fact, that it is probably the most pertinent property of Sindarin for any enthusiasts.
</p>
<p>
  Sindarin has about six types of consonant mutations, but the most important ones are: <span class="soft">soft mutation</span>, <span class="nasal">nasal mutation</span>, and <span class="mixed">mixed mutation</span>. The others are limited in scope, and are known as <span class="stop">stop mutation</span>, <span class="liquid">liquid mutation</span>, and <span class="sibilant">sibilant mutation</span>.
</p>
<p>
  These consonant mutations apply to the initial consonant of a word, either when closely following another word or in compounds.
</p>

<h4>
  Soft mutation
</h4>
<p>
  <span class="soft">Soft mutation</span> - aka <span class="soft">lenition</span> - aka <span class="soft">vocalic mutation</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class="soft">Soft mutation</span> is a systematic lenition (sound-softening process) of initial consonants triggered by certain grammatical environments, such as following the definite article or appearing in compounds.
</p>
<p>
  It "softens" the consonant's articulation without changing its place of articulation, producing predictable alternations used to mark grammatical relationships.
</p>
<pre>
     p → b      b → v      gl → 'l
     t → d      d → dh     gr → 'r
     c → g      g → -      gw → 'w

  (n)d → n     lh → l      s  → h
  (m)b → m     rh → r      h  → ch
  (n)g → ng                hw → chw

  f, l, m, n, r, th unchanged
</pre>
<p>
  <small>
    Previously the <b>m-</b> used to mutate to <b>v-</b>, but in <abbr title="Parma Eldalamberon 23">PE23</abbr> it has been determined that this mutation shouldn't occur because it would create collisions with words starting in <b>b-</b>.<br />
    Don't soft-mutate <b>m-</b>!
  </small>
</p>

<h4>
  Nasal mutation
</h4>
<p>
  The <span class="nasal">nasal mutation</span> is triggered by a preceding <b>n</b> (most often from the plural article <b>in</b> or prepositions like <b>na(n)</b>). It "nasalises" the initial consonant, producing these core effects:
</p>
<pre>
    p  → ph     cl → chl    b  → m
    t  → th     c  → chr    d  → n
    c  → ch     tr → thr    g  → ng
                pr → phr

    dr → n-dr   br → mr    (n)d → nd
    gr → n-gr   bl → ml    (m)b → mb
    gl → n-gl              (n)g → ng
    gw → n-gw

    lh → l      h  → ch
    rh → r      hw → chw     rn → rdh (n becomes dh if preceded by r)

  f, l, m, r, s and th remain
</pre>
<p>
  The preceding nasal itself often drops before the mutated consonant, except before vowels, resistant clusters, and before other nasals (especially with <b>an</b>).
</p>
<small>
(Salo, 75-76)
</small>

<h4>
  Mixed mutation
</h4>
<p>
  The <span class="mixed">mixed mutation</span> was a special pattern — mainly after a debatable genitive preposition <b>en</b> "of" — that begins like soft mutation but then applies nasal effects once the lost historical vowel disappears, producing a more conservative outcome for b/d/g/m and fully restoring ancient mb/nd/ng.
</p>
<p>
  This mutation is documented here for completion, but it's unlikely to be used in modern Neo-Sindarin because the genitive paradigm has changed due to <abbr title="Parma Eldalamberon 23">PE23</abbr> and the <abbr title="Common Eldarin Article">CEA</abbr>.
</p>
<pre>
    p → b       s → h     [m]b → mb
    t → d       h → ch    [n]d → nd
    c → g                 [n]g → ng
  
   wh → 'w
   lh → 'l
   rh → 'r

  Archaic:

   wh → chw
   lh → thl
   rh → thr

  Voiced stops (b, d, g) and nasals (m) are unchanged
</pre>

<h4>
  Stop mutation
</h4>
<p>
  <span class="stop">Stop mutation</span> - aka <span class="stop">hard mutation</span>
</p>
<p>
  The <span class="stop">stop mutation</span> is a rare Sindarin mutation triggered by prepositions that historically ended in -t or -d (notably ed “out of” and o “from”). The ancient stop vanishes before the following consonant, producing these effects:
</p>
<pre>
   p → ph   (n)d → nd      lh → l
   t → th   (m)b → mb      rh → r
   c → ch   (n)g → n-g
  
  h  → ch
  hw → chw

  b, d, f, g, l, m, n, r, s and th remain the same.

  final preposition "ed" before s, f, th becomes es, ef, eth.
</pre>
<p>
  The preposition's final t/d usually disappears, except before liquids (l, r, 'l, 'r, 'w) where it may survive. <span class="stop">Stop mutation</span> is attested only in theoretical notes and is considered optional in Neo-Sindarin.
</p>

<h4>
  Liquid mutation
</h4>
<p>
  The <span class="liquid">liquid mutation</span> is a speculative and probably archaic Sindarin mutation triggered by a preceding l or r. It is attested only in a couple of "Túrin Wrapper" sentences and seems not to operate in later Sindarin.
</p>
<p>
  Because most evidence elsewhere shows no such mutation after liquids, it is treated as an optional/archaic system in Neo-Sindarin.
</p>
<pre>
  p → ph      b → v      [m]b → b
  t → th      d → dh     [n]d → d
  c → ch      g → '      [n]g → g
  
  Nasal m becomes v

  hw → 'w     h → ch
  lh → 'l
  rh → 'r
</pre>

<h4>
  Sibilant mutation
</h4>
<p>
  The <span class="sibilant">sibilant mutation</span> results from an ancient preceding s that caused various mutation effects before being lost.
</p>
<p>
  The two best examples of sibilant mutation are the preposition <b>o</b> "about" and the conjunction <b>a</b> "and".
</p>
<p>
  This mutation has two effects: First, the <b>h</b> which is the normal medial development of <b>s</b> reappears before vowels:
</p>
<pre>
  a<span class="sibilant">h annon</span> or a <span class="sibilant">hannon</span> = "and a gate"
  Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth = "The Debate of Finrod and Andreth"
</pre>
<p>
  The other effect is that the voiceless stops become voiceless spirants (p, t, c → ph, th, ch) and voiced liquids l, r become voiceless lh, rh, where these are the normal phonetic effect of a historical s preceding p, t, c; l, r.
</p>
<p>
  Though not mentioned by Tolkien, it is likely that older initial ch would be preserved rather than becoming h as it does initially, so that initial h would "mutate" to ch. 
</p>
<pre>
  Initial voiceless stops become voiceless spirants:
  p → ph
  t → th
  c → ch

  Older initial ch is preserved:
  h → ch
  
  Voiced liquids become voiceless (possibly archaic):
  l → lh
  r → rh

  b, d, g, [m]b, [n]d, [n]g, s, wh, lh, rh, and m remain the same.
</pre>
<p>
  It is an obscure but plausible mutation for a(h).
