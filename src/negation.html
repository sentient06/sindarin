  Negation is a controversial topic because Tolkien kept changing his mind on how it worked.
</p>
<p>
  There are two chief forms of negation in Sindarin: **u-negation** and **la-negation**.
</p>
<p>
  There's also an interjection **baw** and a verb **pen-** to express lack of something.
</p>

<h4>
  Brief explanation
</h4>
<p>
  Basically, *u-negation* began in early Sindarin as the negative prefix **ú-** with a "bad/unpleasant" sense.
</p>
<p>
  Later on, Tolkien came up with the *la-negation* from primitive syllabic [ḷ], which appeared as prefixes like *il-* or *al-* meaning "no/not" or "opposite". Then it largely disappeared and then re-emerged in the 1930s as **al-** "no, not", which survived in alfirin "immortal".
</p>
<p>
  After The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien briefly rejected *u-negation*, restored *la-negation* for Quenya, then reinterpreted **ú-** as "bad/difficult/impossible", then reversed to traditional *u-negation* again, leaving *la-negation* without any Sindarin examples and its function mainly as a negative prefix of variable strength.
</p>
<p>
  In the end, although not his latest idea of a negation paradigm, the *la-negation* is solid enough to be acceptable to be used along with *u-negation*. So the recommendation is to use both.
</p>

<h4>
  U-negation
</h4>
<p>
  *U-negation* is the most complete system known in Sindarin, originally the **ú-** served as the general verbal negator, inducing §s{soft mutation}, forming quasi-participles, creating adjectives of impossibility (with **-ui**), and underlying an archaic negative verb (**ui** / **ûn**) that could act as a negative copula.
</p>
<p>
  This is the recommended paradigm for Neo-Sindarin when negating verbs.
</p>
<p>
  The *u-negation* produces several distinct negative morphemes with different use cases. For example:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A verbal negator **ú-** which (probably) works as a clitic.<br>
    E.g. *ú-chebin* "I do not keep".
  </li>
  <li>
    A negative prefix **ú-**, which when attached to adjectives/participles simply negates or reverses their meaning.<br>
    E.g. *nodui* "countable" × *únodui* "countless, uncountable".
  </li>
  <li>
    When attached to a noun it creates a noun or an adjective with a related negative meaning.<br>
    E.g. *carth* "deed" × *úgarth* "trespass, misdeed"; *talraph* n. "stirrup" × *udalraph* adj. "stirrupless".
  </li>
  <li>
    There might also be a negative particle **ú** to negate the existence of a noun.
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>
  How to use u-negation
</h5>
<p>
  I recommend using *u-negation* with verbs. It is also possible to use with adjectives, but I prefer to reserve *la-negation* for those.
</p>
<p>
  Simply prefix the word with *ú-*, and then apply §s{soft mutation} to it.
</p>
<p>
  If the word starts on a vowel, we don't have any attested evidence, but the assumption is that **úa-**, **úo-** and **úe-** are preserved as is, and *ú- + -i* would render into **ui-** and *ú- + -u* would yield long **ú-**.
</p>
<p>
  Verbs should simply become negative, and adjectives should have their meaning reversed.
</p>
<pre>
  Verbs:

  beria- = "to protect"
  úveriant loss e·§s{nîr|dîr} = "‹s/he didn't protect› [the] snow man"

  ephola- = "to remember"
  úepholant e·§s{beth|peth} = "‹s/he didn't remember› the word"

  ialla- = "to call"
  uiallannen §s{gin|cin} = "‹I didn't call› you"

  Adjectives:

  bregol  = "quick", "sudden"
  úvregol = "delayed"

  aeg     = "sharp"
  úaeg    = "dull"
</pre>

<h4>
  La-negation
</h4>
<p>
  Similarly to *u-negation*, the *la-negation* also produces distinct negative morphemes.
</p>
<p>
  The *la-negation* mostly operates via the **al-** prefix, but it also manifests itself as a negative particle **law**.
</p>
<p>
  Like *u-negation*, it can be used as a clitic verbal negator **ló** before consonants (*ló-chebin*) and **law** before vowels (*law-aphon*).
</p>

<h5>
  How to use la-negation
</h5>
<p>
  While it's still possible to use *la-negation* with verbs, there is not much evidence of it. It is best to limit its use to adjectives and as a particle for discourse.
</p>
<p>
  Just like *u-negation*, simply prefix a word, particularly an adjective, with *al-*, and then apply §s{soft mutation} to the word.
</p>
<pre>
    baradh = "steep"
  alvaradh = "not steep"

       nûr = "deep"
     alnûr = "shallow"

    bregol = "quick", "sudden"
  alvregol = "delayed"

       aeg = "sharp"
     alaeg = "dull"
</pre>
<p>
  The negative particle [law](https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-393893289.html) can be used before the negated discourse, causing §s{soft mutation}:
</p>
<pre>
  avant yrf, **law** §s{dâd|tâd}, ach neledh    = "‹he ate› apples, **not** two, but three"
  **law** ill hain idh·§n{reniar} líthennin = "**not** all those who wander [are] lost"
</pre>

<h4>
  Negation of volition
</h4>
<p>
  While the **u-negation** and **la-negation** both are concerned with negation of facts, there is a different way to express negation of volition, known as "baw-negation," due to its origin from the root [√BĀ/ABA](https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1104639711.html).
</p>
<p>
  This root actually yields two forms of negation.
</p>
<p>
  The first form is **baw**, derived from the verb *boda-*, meaning "to ban, prohibit", is an interjection used to emphatically express refusal, but it can also be used as a quick interjection "don't!".
</p>
<p>
  The second form is **avo**, which comes from *avad*, meaning "refusal, reluctance". **Avo** is simply used to express a negative command. Its prefixed form is **av-**, but it can also be suffixed with pronominal endings: *avon* "I won't", *avof* "we won't".
</p>
<p>
  Commands addressed to others use **avo**, followed by the regular imperative verb to express command: *avo §s{vado|mado}!* "don't eat!"
</p>

<h5>
  How to use baw-negation
</h5>
<p>
  For refusing things, use **baw** as interjection. For prohibiting someone, use **avo** plus imperative:
</p>
<pre>
  Lindir:  Gliro e·§s{'laer|glaer} ad!         = "Recite the poem again!"
  Legolas: **Baw!** Si §s{mboe|boe} annin lored. = "**No!** I must sleep now."

  Elendil: Iuithathon e·§s{'wachaedir|gwachaedir} ad... = "I will use the palantír again..."
  Elrond:  **Baw!** **Avo** apho e·§s{'wachaedir|gwachaedir}!   = "**Don't!** **Do not** touch the palantír!"
</pre>
<p>
  Note that **avo** can be inflected as a regular verb:
</p>
<pre>
  **avon** mened = "**I won't** go"
  **avo** saedad = "**he won't** teach"
  **avof**       = "**we won't**"
</pre>

<h4>
  Expressing lack of something
</h4>
<p>
  To express the lack of a thing, Sindarin has a word **pen**. It's a versatile term, it can behave as a prefix, as a preposition, and as a verb.
</p>
<p>
  Again, similarly to *u-negation* and *la-negation*, one may use the prefix *pen-* and mutate the following word to achieve a sense similar to English suffix "-less". Examples:
</p>
<pre>
  penbed     = pen + ped    = "unpronounceable"
  pennod     = pen + nod    = "countless"
  pennoediad = pen + nœdiad = "innumerable"
</pre>
<p>
  To use as a verb, the stem is *pen-*:
</p>
<pre>
  penif §s{vast} = "‹we lack› bread"
  penin inc  = "‹I lack› [an] idea"
  pên §s{vlaud}  = "‹he lacks› pride"
</pre>

<h4>
  Negative concord
</h4>
<p>
  Negative concord describes systems where multiple negative elements in a clause express a single semantic negation rather than cancelling each other out.
</p>
<p>
  For example, in French *ils **n'ont** compris **aucun** mot* "they **didn't** understand **any** word", both *ne* and *aucun* contribute to one negation.
</p>
<p>
  Sindarin seem to provide this mechanic in *quantificational negation* (see below.)
</p>
<pre>
  **ú**henianner **ú-beth** o lam i·Naugrim = "‹they **didn't** understand› **no word** from [the] language [of] the Naugrim"
</pre>

<h4>
  Linguistics of negation
</h4>
<div class="image right">
  <img src="img/negation.jpg" alt="What about a paradigm for negation? - Sindarin already has one - We have one, yes, what about a second paradigm for negation? (meme)">
</div>
<p>
  Negation comes in different types. In real-world languages, some types may be natural, possible but unproductive, ungrammatical or semantically odd. We don't have much context to understand how the different types of negation hold in Sindarin, so we might assume all of them work. Yet we can draw from the main inspirations of Sindarin to guess which would be more productive if we had the means to measure it.
</p>
<p>
  Romance languages, English, Welsh and Hebrew, for example, seem to all favour clausal negation and reject nominal negation. So for example, negating a verb is quite common, but negating a noun sounds odd ("not dog", "not water").
</p>
<p>
  The following classification is based on how these languages handle negation:
</p>

<h5>
  Clausal (sentential) negation
</h5>
<p>
  Negates an entire proposition. Clausal negation is verb-centred: the negative marker scopes over the finite verb, not over individual nouns or adjectives. This way, negation attaches to predication:
</p>
<pre>
  **úagammen** = "‹I didn't jump›"
  Aragorn **úlastant** e·rom = "Aragorn **‹didn't hear›** the trumpet"
  Gondor **úmbaura** aran    = "Gondor **‹doesn't need›** [a] king"
</pre>
<p>
  This type of negation is documented in Sindarin, I think it should be encouraged and I suggest using *u-negation* to achieve it.
</p>

<h5>
  Quantificational negation
</h5>
<p>
  This is a negation expressed via negative quantifiers. It causes **negative concords** (see above.)
</p>
<pre>
  **úavannen** *allad*         = "**‹I didn't eat›** *nothing*"
  **alphen** avant *allad*     = "**nobody** ate *nothing*"
  Aragorn **úlastant** *allad* = "Aragorn **‹didn't hear›** *nothing*"
</pre>
<p>
  I would suggest using *u-negation* with the verbs, and *la-negation* with quantifiers.
</p>

<h5>
  Pragmatic / corrective negation
</h5>
<p>
  Discourse-level negation, often corrective. This is a negation used to reject or revise an assumption in discourse, rather than to deny the truth of a proposition.
</p>
<pre>
  sunc **law** miruvor, ach nen    = "‹s/he drank› **not** mead, but water"
  te **law** e·§s{gallon|callon} i mbaurasseb = "he [is] **not** the hero we need"
</pre>
<p>
  I suggest using *law* as the negative particle.
</p>

<h5>
  Lexical / morphological negation
</h5>
<p>
  This kind of negation is built into the word via morphology (not syntax.)
</p>
<p>
  It's very productive in English and Hebrew, a bit limited in Romance languages, and not very productive in Welsh. We can probably extend into Sindarin.
</p>
<pre>
  alhael   = "unwise"
  alnadren = "unreal"
  alfar    = "insufficient"
  pennod   = "without count"
  penestel = "hopeless"
</pre>
<p>
  Sindarin seem to be mechanically ready for this kind of negation, I prefer to use *la-negation* with it, but I think the prefix *pen-* can also create lexical negation. Still, I think it should be limited in scope and used carefully.
</p>

<h5>
  Constituent negation
</h5>
<p>
  This is a negation that targets a specific phrase inside a clause, rather than negating the whole proposition. Only one element is excluded or corrected.
</p>
<p>
  While productive in English, it's limited in Romance, Welsh and Hebrew.
</p>
<pre>
  te **ú** farthannen  = "he [is] **not** satisfied"
  i·maethyr **ú** fair = "the warriors [were] **not** ready"
</pre>
<p>
  Don't confuse this with lexical negation. In the sentence, the words *ú* and *farthannen* are separate on purpose. Merging them into *úfarthannen* "unsatisfied", or *alfarthannen*, causes it to morph into a lexical negation.
</p>
<p>
  I think constituent negation sounds odd and should be avoided in favour of lexical negation.
</p>

<h5>
  Nominal negation
</h5>
<p>
  Nominal negation negates reference, the thing itself. It's not very productive in any of the languages analysed. An example in English could be: "not dog". Yet English may use prefixes that achieve a similar result via lexical negation: "non-sense", "non-issue". English also uses quantificational negation: "no dog", "no water".
</p>
<p>
  It is possible, but its uses are limited.
</p>
<pre>
  da estel §s{bîn|pîn} [...] athen, ach law **alestel** = "there is little hope [...] for him, yet not **‹no hope›**"
    ±*- The Fellowship of the Ring, chapter 2*±
</pre>

<h4>
  Negative correlative coordination
</h4>
<p>
  A negative correlative coordination is a construction where two or more constituents are linked by paired or repeated elements that jointly express negation.<br>
  In English that looks like "neither ... nor."
</p>
<p>
  Sindarin seem to lack any kind of *negative coordinating conjunction* that allows this kind of construction.
</p>
<p>
  Hebrew also lacks a single paired morpheme equivalent to the ones in Romance languages. Coordination in Hebrew is achieved by repeating the negator and linking with the conjunction "and."
</p>
<p>
  We can easily emulate Hebrew and create a similar construction in Sindarin:
</p>
<pre>
  s/he neither eats nor drinks:
  **ú**§s{vâd|mâd} *ah* **ú**§s{hôg|sôg}              = "**‹s/he doesn't eat›** *and* **‹s/he doesn't drink›**"

  neither the father nor the mother:
  **law** en·adar *a* **§i{lhaw|law}** en·emel = "**not** the father *and* **not** the mother"
</pre>
