<p>
  Negation is a controversial topic because Tolkien kept changing his mind on how it worked.
</p>
<p>
  There are two chief forms of negation in Sindarin: **u-negation** and **la-negation**.
</p>
<p>
  There's also an interjection **baw** and a verb **pen-** to express lack of something.
</p>

<h4>
  Brief history
</h4>
<p>
  U-negation began in early Gnomish, then it reappeared in Early Noldorin and became the Sindarin negative prefix **ú-** in the 1930s–50s, sometimes with an added "bad/unpleasant" sense.
</p>
<p>
  La-negation originated from primitive syllabic [ḷ] and appeared early as prefixes like il- or al- meaning "no/not" or "opposite", sometimes shifting form before labials.
</p>
<p>
  It largely disappeared in Early Noldorin, then re-emerged in the 1930s as al- "no, not", which survived in alfirin "immortal".
</p>
<p>
  In 1969, Tolkien briefly rejected *u-negation*, restoring *la-negation* for Quenya, and reinterpreting **ú-** as "bad/difficult/impossible".
</p>
<p>
  Tolkien never provided any Sindarin examples of verbal negation with *la-negation*, leaving its function mainly as a negative prefix of variable strength.
</p>
<p>
  Although not his last idea of a negation paradigm, *la-negation* is well-attested enough to be acceptable to be used along with *u-negation*. So the recommendation is to use both.
</p>

<h4>
  U-negation
</h4>
<p>
  The most complete system was described in 1959, where **ú-** served as the general verbal negator, inducing §soft mutation§, forming quasi-participles, creating adjectives of impossibility (with **-ui**), and underlying an archaic negative verb (**ui** / **ûn**) that could act as a negative copula.
</p>
<p>
  Under that system, **úchebin** would mean "I cannot keep" rather than "I do not keep". But a later note reverses this again: "*Back to ú ... ū should be negative particle*", effectively restoring *u-negation*.
</p>
<p>
  Therefore this is recommended for Neo-Sindarin, especially when negating verbs.
</p>

<p>
  The *u-negation* produces several distinct negative morphemes with different use cases. For example:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A verbal negator **ú-** which (probably) works as a clitic.<br>
    E.g. *ú-chebin* "I do not keep".
  </li>
  <li>
    A negative prefix **ú-**, which when attached to adjectives/participles simply negates or reverses their meaning.<br>
    E.g. *nodui* "countable" × *únodui* "countless, uncountable".
  </li>
  <li>
    When attached to a noun it creates a noun or an adjective with a related negative meaning.<br>
    E.g. *carth* "deed" × *úgarth* "trespass, misdeed"; *talraph* n. "stirrup" × *udalraph* adj. "stirrupless".
  </li>
  <li>
    There might also be a negative particle **ú** to negate the existence of a noun.
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>
  How to use u-negation
</h5>
<p>
  I recommend using *u-negation* with verbs.
</p>
<p>
  Simply prefix the verb with *ú-*, and then apply §soft mutation§ to it:
</p>
<pre>
   beria- = "to protect"
  ú§veria-§ = "to not protect"

   panna- = "to arrange"
  ú§banna-§ = "to not arrange"
</pre>

<h4>
  La-negation
</h4>
<p>
  Similarly to *u-negation*, the *la-negation* also produces distinct negative morphemes.
</p>
<p>
  The *la-negation* mostly operates via the **al-** prefix, but it also manifests itself as a negative particle **law**.
</p>
<p>
  Like *u-negation*, it can be used as a clitic verbal negator **ló** before consonants (*ló-chebin*) and **law** before vowels (*law-aphon*).
</p>

<h5>
  How to use la-negation
</h5>
<p>
  Just like *u-negation*, simply prefix a word, particularly a noun or adjective, with *al-*, and then apply §soft mutation§ to the word:
</p>
<pre>
    baradh = "steep"
  al§varadh§ = "not steep"

    nûr    = "deep"
  alnûr    = "shallow"
</pre>
<p>
  The negative particle [law](https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-393893289.html) can be used as an adverb, typically before the negated word:
</p>
<pre>
  **law** ill hain idh·§§reniar§§ líthennin = "**not** all those who wander [are] lost"
</pre>

<h4>
  Negation of volition
</h4>
<p>
  While the **u-negation** and **la-negation** both are concerned with negation of facts, there is a different way to express negation of volition, known as "baw-negation," due to its origin from the root [√BĀ/ABA](https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1104639711.html).
</p>
<p>
  This root actually yields two forms of negation.
</p>
<p>
  The first form is **baw**, derived from the verb *boda-*, meaning "to ban, prohibit", is an interjection used to emphatically express refusal, but it can also be used as a quick interjection "don't!".
</p>
<p>
  The second form is **avo**, which comes from *avad*, meaning "refusal, reluctance". **Avo** is simply used to express a negative command. Its prefixed form is **av-**, but it can also be suffixed with pronominal endings: *avon* "I won't", *avof* "we won't".
</p>
<p>
  Commands addressed to others use **avo**, followed by the regular imperative verb to express command: *avo §mado§vado§!* "don't eat!"
</p>

<h5>
  How to use baw-negation
</h5>
<p>
  For refusing things, use **baw** as interjection. For prohibiting someone, use **avo** plus imperative:
</p>
<pre>
  Lindir:  Gliro e·§glaer§'laer§ ad!         = "Recite the poem again!"
  Legolas: Baw! Si §boe§mboe§ annin lored. = "No! I must sleep now."

  Elendil: Iuithathon e·§gwachaedir§'wachaedir§ ad... = "I will use the palantír again..."
  Elrond:  Baw! Avo apho e·§gwachaedir§'wachaedir§!   = "Don't! Do not touch the palantír!"
</pre>
<p>
  Note that **avo** can be inflected as a regular verb:
</p>
<pre>
  avon mened = "I won't go"
  avo saedad = "he won't teach"
  avof       = "we won't"
</pre>

<h4>
  Negative concord
</h4>
<p>
  Negative concord describes systems where multiple negative elements in a clause express a single semantic negation rather than cancelling each other out.
</p>
<p>
  For example, in French *ils **n'ont** compris **aucun** mot* "they **didn't** understand **any** word", both *ne* and *aucun* contribute to one negation.
</p>
<p>
  Sindarin seem to lack this kind of mechanic, so to express the same idea, we can use single negation, like in German: *Sie verstanden **kein** Wort* "they understood **no** word":
</p>
<pre>
  henianner **ú-beth** o lam i·Naugrim = "‹they understood› **no word** from [the] language [of] the Naugrim"
</pre>

<h4>
  Recommendation
</h4>
<p>
  For Neo-Sindarin verbs, it's best to use the attested *u-negation* (**ú-** with §soft mutation§), since it is well described and appears to have been restored by Tolkien after 1969, whereas *la-negation* has no Sindarin verbal examples and relies partly on neologisms (e.g., law "no, not").
</p>
<p>
  For all other negation, *la-negation* is still retained as a neutral negative prefix (especially al-).
</p>
<p>
  For negatives of volition, Neo-Sindarin should follow Tolkien's attested system of using *baw* and *avo*.
</p>
<p>
  The best-known Sindarin example is ***úchebin*** *estel anim* "I have kept no hope for myself".
</p>
<p>
  Here, **ú-** is a neutral verbal negator. Similar prefixes appear in later vocabulary (*udalraph*, *úmarth*, *úgarth*).
