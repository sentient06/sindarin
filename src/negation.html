<p>
  Negation is a controversial topic because Tolkien kept changing his mind on how it worked.
</p>
<p>
  There are two chief forms of negation in Sindarin: <b>u-negation</b> and <b>la-negation</b>. There's also a third form known as <b>baw-negation</b>, which mainly concerns imperatives, and the neologism <b>law</b> for "not".
</p>

<h4>
  Description
</h4>
<h5>
  U-negation
</h5>
<p>
  U-negation began in early Gnomish, then it reappeared in Early Noldorin and became the Sindarin negative prefix ú- in the 1930s–50s, sometimes with an added "bad/unpleasant" sense.
</p>
<p>
  The most complete system was described in 1959, where ú- served as the general verbal negator, inducing soft mutation, forming quasi-participles, creating adjectives of impossibility (with -ui), and underlying an archaic negative verb (ui / ûn) that could act as a negative copula.
</p>
<p>
  In 1969, Tolkien briefly rejected <b>u-negation</b>, restoring <b>la-negation</b> for Quenya, and reinterpreting <b>ú-</b> as "bad/difficult/impossible".
</p>
<p>
  Under that system, <b>úchebin</b> would mean "I cannot keep" rather than "I do not keep". But a later note reverses this again: "Back to ú ... ū should be negative particle", effectively restoring <b>u-negation</b>.
</p>
<p>
  Therefore this is recommended for Neo-Sindarin.
</p>

<h5>
  La-negation
</h5>
<div class="image right">
  <img src="img/negation.jpg" alt="What about a paradigm for negation? - Sindarin already has one - We have one, yes, what about a second paradigm for negation? (meme)">
</div>
<p>
  La-negation originated from primitive syllabic ḷ and appeared early as prefixes like il- or al- meaning "no/not" or "opposite", sometimes shifting form before labials.
</p>
<p>
  It largely disappeared in Early Noldorin, then re-emerged in the 1930s as al- "no, not", which survived in alfirin "immortal".
</p>
<p>
  Tolkien later rejected and then briefly restored la-negation in 1969, but he never provided any Sindarin examples of verbal negation with it, leaving its function mainly as a negative prefix of variable strength.
</p>

<h5>
  Baw-negation
</h5>
<p>
  Baw-negation was introduced in 1959 from √BĀ/ABA "refuse, forbid" as a distinct type of negation marking refusal or prohibition rather than denial of fact.
</p>
<p>
  This is actually two forms of negation.
</p>
<p>
  The first form is <b>avo</b>, and it comes from <i>avad</i>, meaning "refusal, reluctance".
</p>
<p>
  The second form is <b>baw</b>, derived from the verb <i>boda-</i>, meaning "to ban, prohibit".
</p>
<p>
  <b>Avo</b> can be used with imperative verbs ("don't do [that]"), its prefixed form <b>av-</b>, and personalized forms like avon "I won't" and avam "we won't".
</p>
<p>
  These always express the speaker's refusal, while commands addressed to others use <b>baw</b> or <b>avo/av-</b>. This system remained stable even when Tolkien vacillated on la- vs u-negation.
</p>

<h4>
  Recommendation
</h4>
<p>
  For Neo-Sindarin, it's best to use the attested u-negation (ú- with soft mutation) for verbal negation, since it is well described and appears to have been restored by Tolkien after 1969, whereas la-negation has no Sindarin verbal examples and relies partly on neologisms (e.g., law "no, not").
</p>
<p>
  La-negation is still retained as a neutral negative prefix (especially al-).
</p>
<p>
  For negatives of volition, Neo-Sindarin should follow Tolkien's attested system: baw! for prohibitions, avo + mutated imperative for "don't", and avon/avof for "I/we won't", reserving verbs like boda- "refuse" when the refusal is attributed to someone else.
</p>
<p>
  The best-known Sindarin example is <i>ú-chebin estel anim</i> "I have kept no hope for myself".
</p>
<p>
  Here, <b>ú-</b> is a neutral verbal negator. Similar prefixes appear in later vocabulary (Udalraph, Úmarth, úgarth).
</p>
<p>
  The most complete description comes from Tolkien's 1959 "Definitive Linguistic Notes", where <b>u-negation</b> is systematic:
</p>

<div class="wrapper">
<div class="a1">
  û used as an adverb/interjection "no, not (of fact)"
</div>
<div class="a2">
  ?
</div>

<div class="a1">
  ú- as a general negative prefix
  (especially with verbs and adjectives)
</div>
<div class="a2">
  ú-chebin estel anim = "‹I have <b>not-kept</b>› hope ‹for myself›"
  ú-land = "not broad"
</div>

<div class="a1">
  Prefixed to bare verb stems, ú- forms quasi-participles
</div>
<div class="a2">
  únod = "not counting"
  úbed = "not saying"
</div>

<div class="a1">
  With the continuative suffix -ol, it expresses ongoing negation
</div>
<div class="a2">
  úgarol = "is not now doing"
</div>

<div class="a1">
  With -ui, it forms adjectives meaning "not suitable/not possible"
</div>
<div class="a2">
  úbedui = "unspeakable"
  únodui = "countless"
</div>

<div class="a1">
  Sentence negation is done by prefixing ú- to verb forms
</div>
<div class="a2">
  úvedin = "I do not eat"
  ú-gar  = "he does not do"
</div>

<div class="a1">
  An archaic negative verb existed: present ui, past ûn
  Usable with uninflected verb stems
  Possibly functioning as a negative copula ("I am not ...")
</div>
<div class="a2">
  †uin gar = "I do not make"
</div>

</div>

<p>
  La-negation is so called based on the LA root, but in Sindarin it shows up as <b>al-</b>. It's recommended to use it with anything that's not a verb.
</p>
<pre>
  alphen   = pronoun "nobody"
  alphirin = adjective and noun "immortal"
  alnad    = pronoun "nothing"
  alhad    = pronoun "nowhere"
  alnûr    = adjective "not deep, shallow"
</pre>

<p>
  Use baw-negation for negative imperatives. These are always negated from the perspective of the speaker.
</p>
<p>
  Always refuse a command with av-. Prohibit with both av- and baw:
</p>
<pre>
  avo <span class="soft">garo</span>! = "don't do it!"
  avgaro!   = "don't do it!"
  avo <span class="soft">vado</span>  = "don't eat"
  avon      = "I won't"
  avam      = "we won't"
  
  baw!      = "don't!"
  baw <span class="soft">vado</span>! = "don't eat!"
  baw <span class="soft">veno</span>! = "don't go!"
</pre>

<p>
  Finally, the word <a href="https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-393893289.html" target="_blank">law</a> can be used as a negative particle before other words:
</p>
<pre>
  <b>law</b> ill hain idh <span class="nasal">reniar</span> líthennin = "<b>not</b> all those who wander [are] lost"
</pre>
