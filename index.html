<h2>Independent personal pronouns</h2>

<p>
  In Sindarin, we don't use traditional personal pronouns. That's because pronouns are typically represented as suffixes to conjugated verbs.
</p>
<p>
  There are, however, independent pronouns, which can be used on certain circumstances (such as when a subject has been mentioned and needs to be referred to again):
</p>

<h3>
  Independent pronouns
</h3>

<p>
  Singular
</p>
<code>
  <pre>
    1st person I/me       ni
    2nd person thou       ci
    2nd person (polite)   le
    3rd person he/she/it  te
  </pre>
</code>
<p>
  Plural
</p>
<code>
  <pre>
    1st person we      me
    2nd person you     de
    3rd person they    ti

    Reflexive pronoun  im
  </pre>
</code>

<p>
  The last pronoun "im" means "self" ("same") and is used for all persons. It has a meaning of "I myself", "he himself", "your yourselves", and so on.
</p>
<h3>
  Suffix pronouns
</h3>
<p>
  In Romance languages, among others, there is a concept known as "implied subject", or "understood subject". It might also be called "elliptical subject" or "zero subject".
</p>
<p>
  An implied subject refers to a subject that is not explicitly stated but is understood from context, mostly because of how the verb in conjugated.
</p>
<p>
  In English, one example is the "you" in imperative sentences, e.g. "go home!" → "[You] go home!".
</p>
<p>
  In Sindarin, implied subjects are used at all times, except if absolutely required for the sentence to make sense. As in Romance languages, the verb is modified. In Sindarin, that means that a suffix is used.
</p>
<p>
  The suffixes used with verbs are the following:
</p>

<p>
  Singular
</p>
<code>
  <pre>
    1st person I          -n
    2nd person thou       -g
    2nd person (polite)   -l
    3rd person he/she/it  (nothing)
  </pre>
</code>
<p>
  Plural
</p>
<code>
  <pre>
    1st person we (not you) -f
    1st person we (and you) -b
    2nd person you          -gir
    2nd person (polite)     -dhir
    3rd person they         -r
  </pre>
</code>

<h4>
  Example for all personal pronouns
</h4>
<p>
  Verb gala- ("to grow"):
</p>

<code>
  <pre>
   I grow    - galon
Thou growest - galog
Thou growest - galol (polite)
  He grows   - gala

  we grow    - galof
  we grow    - galab
 you grow    - galgir
 you grow    - galodh / galodhir (polite)
they grow    - galar
  </pre>
</code>


<a name="to_be" />
<h2>The "to be" verb</h2>
<a href="">[Top]</a>

<p>
  The "to be" verb exists on published texts only as imperative "no".
</p>
<p>
  "To be" is implied most of the time by the sequence of words.
</p>
<p>
  That said, a few times, a proper conjugation is needed, so it has been reconstructed based on evidence.
</p>
<p>
  We omit the verb na- in almost all "to be" phrases:
  <pre>
  Elrond edhel "Elrond [is] an elf".
  </pre>
</p>
<p>
  Predicate nouns and adjectives are not mutated:
  <pre>
  en edhel bain "the Elf [is] beautiful".
  </pre>
  Less ambiguously:
  <pre>
  bain en edhel "beautiful [is] the Elf".
  </pre>
</p>
<p>
  The predicate matches the subject in number:
  <pre>
  in edain belig "the men [are] mighty (beleg-plural)".
  </pre>
  Less ambiguously:
  <pre>
  belig in edain "mighty [are] the men".
  </pre>
</p>
<p>
  Use independent pronouns as subjects for "to be" phrases:
  <pre>
  me edhil "we [are] Elves".
  </pre>
</p>
<!--
<h5>
  Speculation
</h5>
<p>
Use past and future copulas *nî and tho for "was" and "will be":
  <pre>
  Elrond nî ennas "Elrond was there",
  Elrond tho hí "Elrond will be here".
  </pre>
</p>
<p>
These past and future copulas are inflected with pronominal suffixes as appropriate:
  <pre>
  nîn ennas "I was there",
  thof hí "we will be here".
  </pre>
</p>

<a name="basic_nouns" />
<h2>Basic nouns</h2>
<a href="">[Top]</a>

<p>
  Nouns can be definite or indefinite, singular or plural.
</p>
<p>
  Plural nouns go through vowel mutations.
</p>

<h3>
  Plural nouns
</h3>
<p>
  Plurals in Sindarin go through i-affection. This is the result of an ancient plural suffix ī which has been lost in modern Sindarin plurals.
</p>
<p>
  There are 3 types of i-affection:
  <ul>
    <li>internal i-affection</li>
    <li>final i-affection</li>
    <li>final i-intrusion</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h4>Internal i-affection</h4>
<p>
  Occurs only in non-final syllables:
  <pre>
  Non-final a → e: adan "man" → edain "men"
  Non-final o → e: onod "Ent" → enyd "Ents"
  Non-final u → y: [N.] tulus "poplar" → tylys "poplars"

  Other vowels in non-final syllables (e, i, y) do not mutate.
  Long vowels in non-final syllables (í, ó, ú, ý) do not mutate.
  Archaically o → œ: golodh “Gnome” → gœlydh "Gnomes".
  </pre>
</p>

<h4>Final i-affection</h4>
<p>
Occurs only in final syllables:
  <pre>
  Final a → e: narn "tale" → nern "tales".
  Final e → i: edhel "elf" → edhil "elves".
  Final ê → î: hên "child" → hîn "children".
  Final o → y: orch "orch" → yrch "orcs".
  Final u → y: [N.] tulus "poplar" → tylys "poplars".

  Other short vowels in final syllables (i, y) do not mutate.
  </pre>
</p>

<h4>Final i-intrusion</h4>
<p>
Happens when the last syllable ends in a single consonant:

  <pre>
  Intruded a → ai: adan "man" → edain "men".
  Intruded â → ai: bâr "home" → bair "homes".
  Intruded ô → ui: thôn "pine" → thuin "pines"; monosyllables only.
  Intruded û → ui: dûr "dark" → duir "dark (plural)"; monosyllables only.
  Intruded au → oe: naug "dwarf" → noeg "dwarves".

  The long vowels î, ŷ in final syllables do not mutate. The vowels e/ê, o, u undergo final i-affection instead (to i/î, y, y).
  </pre>
</p>

<h4>Rare diphthongs plurals</h4>
<p>
Plurals of rarer diphthongs are the result of other phonetic effects:
  <pre>
  Rare oe → ui: oew "evil deed" → *uiw "evil deeds".
  Rare eu → ŷ: teuch "chip" → *tŷch "chips".
  </pre>
</p>
<p>
  The diphthongs ae, ei, ai, ui do not normally mutate in plurals, even in final syllables, but there are some unusual plurals where they do. Diphthongs never mutate in non-final syllables, however.
</p>

<h4>Unusual plurals</h4>
<p>
  Sindarin has a number of plural patterns resulting from more obscure sound changes.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <span>
      Long or short ó/o derived from au resists mutations in non-final syllables, and might mutate to oe in final syllables of recognized compounds.
    </span>
    <pre>
  Ódhil → Ódhel (< ✶aw(a)delo) "Elf [who left for Aman]"
  Rodyn → Rodon (= raud + -on) "Vala"</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>
      The diphthong ai in final syllables might mutated to î (monosyllable) or i (polysyllable) depending on the ancient form of the word.
    </span>
    <pre>  cair → cîr "ship" (✶kiryā)
  gail → gîl "star" (✶gilyā)</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>
      When a vowel mutates to i or y in its plural, it absorbs any preceding i, as in: Miniel → Mínil, thalion → thelyn.
    </span>
    <pre></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>
      When a polysyllable ends in a short vowel, it generally follows the same mutations as in polysyllables ending in a single consonant: -a → -ai, -e → -i, -o/u → -y.
    </span>
    <pre></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>
      One exception is when a final -a is derived from an ancient g > ʒ > -a, in which case in plurals: -a → -i.
    </span>
    <pre></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>
      When a monosyllable ends in a long vowel, it generally follows the same mutations as in monosyllables ending in a single consonant: -â → -ai, -ê → -î, -ô/û → -ui.
    </span>
    <pre></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>
      When a monosyllable ends in a diphthong, its plural mutations are -êw → -îw and -aw → -oe(w); other diphthongs are immune to mutation.
    </span>
    <pre></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>
      Some Sindarin plurals are formed with the plural suffix -in, either a remnant of an ancient n preserved in the plural, or a generalization of this suffix applied to other situations.
    </span>
    <pre></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>
      Sometimes the Sindarin plural becomes the base form, and a singular is derived from it using the suffixes -eg, -ig, -og or -od.
    </span>
    <pre></pre>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  More info: <a href="https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-242834451.html" target="_blank">Eldamo: S. unusual plurals</a>.
</p>

<h3>Class plural</h3>

<p>
  Sindarin has a second plural form using suffixes like -ath, -hoth or -rim.
</p>

<pre>
  êl     "star" , elin   "stars"  , elenath   "all stars".
  orch   "orc"  , yrch   "orcs"   , orchoth   "all orcs".
  Nogoth "Dwarf", Negyth "Dwarves", Nogothrim "all Dwarves".
</pre>
<p>
  -ath is by far the most common class plural suffix, which seems to be the "default" suffix. It is the only one used with inanimate items like elenath "all stars" and sammath "(all of the) chambers".
</p>
<p>
  -hoth is mostly used for "bad" groups given its connotation of "horde".
</p>
<p>
  Some class plural suffixes -rim, -hoth and -waith are used for groups of people: orchoth, Rohirrim, Forodwaith. These mostly formed ordinary compounds.
</p>
<p>
  The suffix -ath may preserve (or restore) ancient final endings to words that were lost in the singular form.
</p>
<pre>
   êl     "star"     → elenath    "all stars".
   Feir   "Mortal"   → Firiath    "(all) Mortals".
   gail   "star"     → giliath    "host of stars".
   Perian "Halfling" → Periannath "Hobbits (as a race)".
N. ceir   "ship"     → círiath    "(all) ships".
N. lhîn   "pool"     → lhiniath   "(all of the) pools".
N. sîr    "river"    → siriath    "(all of the) rivers".
</pre>

<h3>Dual nouns</h3>
<p>
  Sindarin once had a dual inflection, used for pairs of objects, but in Sindarin this dual has fallen out of use because final vowels vanished in Sindarin.
</p>
<p>
  However, there are remnants of a dual in fossilized forms.
</p>
<pre>
  lheweg     "ears (of one person)" (*slasū > lhahu > lhau, spelled lhaw)
  Orgaladhad "Day of Two Trees (galadh)"
  samarad    "two neighbours (sammar)"
  nobad      "thumb and index finger as a pair, *(lit.) pickers"
  hent       "two eyes (hen)"
</pre>


<a name="basic_verbs" />
<h2>Basic Verbs</h2>
<a href="">[Top]</a>
<p>
  Sindarin verbs are inflected for tense, number and person.
</p>
<p>
  There are two major classes of verbs: Basic and derived.
</p>

<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  -->
<h3>Basic verbs</h3>
<p>
  They are based on an unadorned primitive verbal root. They are also known as i-stem.
</p>
<p>
  Basic verbs are usually represented by stems ending in a consonant as in: ped- "to say, speak".
</p>

<p>
  Monosyllabic basic verbs are lengthened: câr "do, make" (car-).
</p>
<p>
  Then pronominal suffixes are added, the ancient aorist suffix i is preserved, which causes internal i-affection of the base vowel: cerin "I do" (car-). For many basic verbs, the vowel becomes e in an inflected present tense.
</p>
<pre>
  car-: present tense cerin "I do".
  heb-: present tense hebin "I keep".
  tol-: present tense telin "I come".
</pre>
<p>
  Because of the large number of collisions in the present tense, basic verbs are less likely to survive, and that's we see derived verbs or prefixed verbs in Sindarin where their Quenya equivalents are basic verbs.
</p>
<pre>
  S. cova-   "assemble"    vs.  Q. ócom-
  S. díhena- "forgive"     vs.  Q. apsen-
  S. echad-  "shape out"   vs.  Q. cat-
  S. groga-  "feel terror" vs.  Q. ruc-
  S. hadhwa- "sea"         vs.  Q. har-
  N. nara-   "tell"        vs. ᴹQ. nyar-
  N. taetha- "fasten"      vs. ᴹQ. tak-
  N. teitha- "write"       vs. ᴹQ. tek-
  N. telia-  "play"        vs. ᴹQ. tyal-
  N. toba-   "cover"       vs. ᴹQ. top-
</pre>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  car- (to do)

  1st person - cerin      - I do
  2nd person - cerig      - thou dost
  2nd person - ceril      - thou dost (polite)
  2nd person - ceridh     - thou dost (archaic polite)
  3rd person - câr        - he/she does

  1st person - cerif      - we do
  2nd person - ceridh(ir) - you do
  3rd person - cerir      - they do
</pre>




<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  -->
<h3>Derived verbs</h3>
<p>
  They are produced with some kind of verbal suffix. They are also known as a-stem.
</p>
<p>
  Derived verbs generally appear with stems ending in a as in: teitha- "to write".
</p>
<p>
  The infinitive is formed with the ending -o, displacing the ending -a:
</p>
<pre>
  bronia- "endure" > bronio "to endure"
</pre>
<p>
  The 3rd person singular present tense is identical to the unadorned verb stem itself:
</p>
<pre>
  bronia- "endure" > bronia "endures, is enduring"
</pre>
<p>
  Pronominal suffixes make the final a of the verb change to o as in galon "I grow" (gala-).
</p>
<pre>
  broniar "(they) endure"
  broniam "we endure"
</pre>
<p>
  The ending -n for "I" causes the final -a to become -o instead:
</p>
<pre>
  bronion "I endure",
  dagron "I make war"
</pre>

<p>
  Example
</p>
<pre>
  gala- (to grow)

  1st person - galon      - I grow
  2nd person - galog      - thou growest
  2nd person - galol      - thou growest
  2nd person - galodh     - thou growest
  3rd person - gala       - he/she grows

  1st person - galof      - we grow
  2nd person - galodh(ir) - you grow
  3rd person - galar      - they grow
</pre>
<hr>

(past tense)
<p>
  The 3rd person singular past tense of this class of verbs is in most cases formed with the suffix -nt:
</p>
<pre>
  bronia- "endure" > broniant "endured"
</pre>
<p>
  The suffix -nt becomes -nne- before the ending follows:
</p>
<pre>
  broniant "endured" > bronianner "they endured"
  (also plural, e.g. in Edhil bronianner "the Elves endured")

  broniannen "I endured",
  broniannem "we endured"
</pre>



<h3>Half-strong and irregular verbs</h3>
<p>
  There's also a minor class called half-strong verbs.
</p>

<pre>
  Half-Strong verb:
  tangad(a)- (to make firm, to confirm)

  1st person - tangadan      - I confirm
  2nd person - tangadag      - thou confirmest
  2nd person - tangadal      - thou confirmest
  2nd person - tangadadh     - thou confirmest
  3rd person - tangod        - he/she confirms

  1st person - tangadaf      - we confirm
  2nd person - tangadadh(ir) - you confirm
  3rd person - tangadar      - they confirm
</pre>

<h3>Verbal nouns (gerund)</h3>

<p>
  Verbal nouns function as both gerunds and infinitives, and behave in all respects like nouns except:<br />
  (a) they cannot be inflected in the plural and<br />
  (b) are not mutated when functioning as the infinitival object of another verb.
</p>
<p>
Basic verbs:
  add -ed
</p>
<p>
Derived verbs ending in -a:
  add -d
</p>
<pre>
  car- (to do) = cared (doing)
</pre>
<p>
  It works as an object to another verb, like English infinitive.
  E.g.
</p>
<pre>
  nidhin mened "I intend to go"
</pre>

<p>
  A verbal noun does not undergo soft mutation.
</p>
<p>
  A verbal noun may follow a verb, but an adverb may be in the middle as well.
  E.g.
</p>
<pre>
  e aníra ennas suilannad "he desires there to greet" (ennas = there)
</pre>

<p>
  The gerund/infinitive itself can take a direct object, which DOES undergo the usual soft mutation.
  E.g.
</p>
<pre>
  aníra ... suilannad mhellyn "desires to greet friends" (mhellyn is mutated).
</pre>

<h2>Mutations</h2>
<a href="">[Top]</a>

<p>
  Mutation is where the ends and beginings of words interact. Mutations are related to Sindarin's phonetic history.
</p>
<p>
  Sindarin has several types of consonant mutations, but the most important are soft mutation, nasal mutation, and mixed mutation.
</p>
<p>
  These consonant mutations apply to the initial consonant of a word, either when closely following another word or in compounds.

  p, t, c → b, d, g

  Voiced stops (b, d, g) and nasals (m) are unchanged

  Spirants become softer spirants:
  
  s, h → h, ch
  
  Ancient nasalized stops are fully restored:
  
  [m]b, [n]d, [n]g → mb, nd, ng

  Voiceless sounds are voiced:
  
  wh, lh, rh → 'w, 'l, 'r

  Archaically:

  wh, lh, rh → chw, thl, thr
</pre>

<h3>Stop mutation</h3>
<p>
  aka hard mutation
</p>
<pre>
  voiceless stops p, t, c become voiceless fricatives ph, th, ch.
  nasal voiced stops (n)d, (m)b, (n)g become nasal + stops nd, mb, n-g.
  voiceless liquids lh, rh become liquids l, r.
  h and hw become ch and chw.

  b, d, f, g, l, m, n, r, s and th remain the same.

  final preposition "ed" before s, f, th becomes es, ef, eth.
</pre>

<h3>Liquid mutation</h3>
<pre>
  Initial voiceless stops become voiceless spirants:
  p, t, c → ph, th, ch
  
  Initial voiced stops become voiced spirants or are lost:

  b, d, g → v, dh, '

  Initial nasalized voiced stops do not mutate:
  
  [m]b, [n]d, [n]g remain b, d, g
  
  Nasal m becomes v

  Voiceless sounds are voiced to 
  hw, lh, rh → 'w, 'l, 'r
  
  h becomes ch
</pre>

<h3>Sibilant mutation</h3>
<p>
  The sibilant mutation results from an ancient preceding s that caused various mutation effects before being lost.
</p>
<p>
  The two best examples of sibilant mutation are the preposition o "about" and the conjunction a "and".
</p>
<p>
  This mutation has two affects: First, the h which is the normal medial development of s reappears before vowels:
</p>
<pre>
  ah annon or a hannon = "and a gate"
  Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth = "The Debate of Finrod and Andreth"
</pre>
<p>
  The other effect is that the voiceless stops become voiceless spirants (p, t, c → ph, th, ch) and voiced liquids l, r become voiceless lh, rh, where these are the normal phonetic effect of a historical s preceding p, t, c; l, r.
</p>
<p>
  Though not mentioned by Tolkien, it is likely that older initial ch would be preserved rather than becoming h as it does initially, so that initial h would "mutate" to ch. 
</p>
<pre>
  Initial voiceless stops become voiceless spirants:
  p, t, c → ph, th, ch

  h becomes ch
  
  Voiced liquids become voiceless (possibly archaic):
  l, r → lh, rh 
</pre>

<a name="articles" />
<h2>Articles</h2>
<a href="">[Top]</a>
<p>
  Sindarin has no indefinite article like English "a, an"; the absence of a definite article indicates that the noun is indefinite:
</p>
<pre>
  Edhel = "Elf" or "an Elf"
</pre>
<p>
  Use:
</p>
<pre>
  e/en singular
  i/in plural
</pre>

<a name="adjectives" />
<h2>Adjectives</h2>
<a href="">[Top]</a>
<p>
  Adjectives generally appear after the nouns they modify. Then they undergo soft mutation.
</p>
<p>
  Adjectives are inflected into the plural to agree with their noun.
</p>
<p>
  <i>Old style:</i><br />
  Adjectives in "to be" statements do not undergo soft mutation.
</p>
<p>
  Quantitative adjectives precede the noun.
</p>
<p>
  <i>
    Adverbs following verbs are not lenited, so adjectives acting as adverbs possibly are not lenited either?
  </i>
</p>

<h3>CEA</h3>
<p>
  Neo-Sindarin should indeed distinguish these functions via word order, positioning a predicative adjective before a (definite) noun.
</p>
<pre>
  Edhel dond      = a tall Elf
  tond Edhel      = a tall Elf (permissible but not standard in normal colloquial speech)
  en-Edhel dond   = the tall Elf
  e-dond Edhel    = the tall Elf (not standard in colloquial speech)
  tond en-Edhel   = the Elf is tall
</pre>
<p>
  For "an Elf is tall" (predicative + indefinite), I'd use "some" as a quantifier.
</p>
<p>
  For a generic statement "Elves are tall", I'm not sure. Either we accept an inevitable ambiguity, or perhaps we can disambiguate this by adding a pronoun (Edhil ti dynd = "Elves, they are tall").
</p>

<p>
 One popular Neo-Sindarin practice is to have adjectives in "to be" statements not undergo soft mutation, to make it easier to distinguish:
</p>
<pre>
  in edain delin  = "the men (are) hidden"
  in edain dhelin = "the hidden men"
</pre>

<a name="copula" />
<h2>Copula</h2>
<a href="">[Top]</a>
<p>
  In English, "to be" statements are phrased with the verb conjugated as in "you are wise", "Elrond is an elf".
</p>
<p>
  In linguistics a word like "is" or "are" is called a "copula", which is a simply a small linking word connecting the subject (you, Elrond) to its predicate (wise, an Elf).
</p>
<p>
  The Elvish languages are notable in that they do not normally use a copula word in such sentences: the subject and predicate are simply placed next to each other with no joining word (in linguistics this is referred to as a "zero copula").
</p>
<p>
  Neo-Sindarin writers use an independent pronoun together with its predicate for "to be" statements that use pronouns:
</p>
<pre>
  me elidh = "we [are] Elves"
  le sael  = "you [are] wise"
  ti belig = "they [are] mighty"
</pre>
<p>
  In this system, the predicate noun or adjective matches the subject in number, but it is generally believed that a predicate adjective is not lenited.
</p>
<p>
  Summarising:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <span>Omit the verb na- in almost all "to be" phrases:</span>
    <pre>
  Elrond edhel = "Elrond [is] an elf"
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>Predicate nouns and adjectives are not mutated:</span>
    <pre>
  i edhel bain = "the Elf [is] beautiful"
  bain i edhel = "beautiful [is] the Elf"
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>The predicate matches the subject in number:</span>
    <pre>
  in edain belig = "the men [are] mighty (beleg-plural)"
  belig in edain = "mighty [are] the men"
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Use independent pronouns as subjects for "to be" phrases:
    <pre>
  me edhil = "we [are] Elves"
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Use past and future copulas *nî and tho for "was" and "will be":
    <pre>
  Elrond nî ennas = "Elrond was there"
  Elrond tho hí   = "Elrond will be here"
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    These past and future copulas are inflected with pronominal suffixes as appropriate:
    <pre>
  nîn ennas = "I was there"
  thof hí   = "we will be here"
    </pre>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Basic grammar part II</h2>
<a href="">[Top]</a>
<a name="basic_sentence_structure" />
<h2>Basic Sentence Structure</h2>

<p>
  The word order of transitive verbs in Sindarin is usually SPO (subject-predicate-object):
</p>
<pre>
  Aragorn anglennatha i Varanduiniant. = "Aragorn will approach the Baranduin Bridge"
  E aníra suilannad vellyn în.         = "He wants to greet his friends"
</pre>

<p>
  However, if the object is a pronoun, the word order is SOP:
</p>
<pre>
  Narvi hain echant = "Narvi made them"
</pre>

<p>
  For intransitive verbs and predicative adjectives, the word order is PS:
</p>
<pre>
    Tôl acharn    = "Revenge comes"
    Brann i annon = "The gate is high"
</pre>

<p>
  <i>
    Old assumptions:
  </i>
</p>
<p>
  Relative clauses in Sindarin are introduced with the article i, which here functions as a relative pronoun.
</p>
<p>
  If the verb follows immediately afterward, some examples are known with and without mutation.
</p>
<p>
  We therefore assume that i can be used in both the singular and plural, with or without lenition.
</p>
<p>
  In the plural, "in" can also be used alternatively with a nasal mutation:
</p>
<pre>
   cuina- (live)    - Dor Firn/Gyrth i Guinar = "land of the dead who live"
   cuina- (live)    - Dor Gyrth i chuinar     = "land of the dead who live"
  gohena- (forgive) - i gohenam di            = "we who forgive them"
</pre>
<p>
  When combined with the dative, the contracted form ai "the...; for the; for those..." is used:
</p>
<pre>
    i gohenam di ai gerir úgerth ammen (which we forgive those who sin against us) [literally: "do sins", from car - (to do)]
</pre>

<p>
  <b>
    New findings
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  According to PE23:
</p>
<p>
  Verbs following their
  <ul>
    <li>subjects,</li>
    <li>nouns or</li>
    <li>emphatic pronouns</li>
  </ul>
  and go through soft mutation.
</p>
<p>
  The pronominal subjects of verbs had been agglutinated to the verbal stems already in CE.
</p>
<p>
  The normal sentence order in Q., T., and S. was subject, verb, first object, second object.
</p>
<p>
  But order was probably freer in CE, and in any case the weaker unemphatic pronominal words were evidently usually subordinated to the important verb stem.
</p>

<h3>Direct objects</h3>
<p>
  Direct objects follow a transitive verb.

<a href="#top">[Top]</a>
<a name="prepositions" />
<h2>Prepositions</h2>
<p>
  When a preposition is used adverbially and follows immediately after the verb, it is lenited.
</p>
<p>
  Most usual Sindarin prepositions:
</p>
<pre>
  ab     + noun lenition      = 'after'
  adel   + noun lenition      = 'behind'
  ah                          = 'with'
  am     + noun soft mutation = 'up'
  an     + nasal mutation     = 'to, towards' --> Before m, an becomes am, and an- for comparisons + b becomes am- + m
  ath    + noun soft mutation = 'on both sides, across'
  athan                       = 'beyond'
  athra  + noun soft mutation = 'across'
  be     + noun soft mutation = 'according to'
  bo     + normal noun        = 'on'
  dad    + noun soft mutation = 'down'
  dan    + nasal mutation     = 'against'
  di     + noun soft mutation = 'under, beneath'
  ed     + hard mutation      = 'out from'
  im                          = 'between'
  min                         = 'between'
  na     + noun soft mutation = 'to, towards; at; with, by'
  ned    + hard mutation      = 'in'
  nef                         = 'on this side'
  nu     + noun soft mutation = 'under'
  o      + hard mutation      = 'about'
  o (od) + hard mutation      = 'from'
  or                          = 'over, above'
  pen    + nasal mutation     = 'without'
  ter                         = 'through'
  thar                        = 'across'
  trî    + noun soft mutation = 'through'
  vi     + normal noun        = 'in'

<p>
  <i>
    Re: nan vs. mo - I don't agree with using mo for "filled with trees".
    My understanding of mo, based on its etymology and gloss, is that it is an element introducing an agent.
    So mo here would be used to clarify by whom "it was filled with trees", not what it was filled with.
    I am not entirely convinced nan is corrected either, but IMO it certainly shouldn't be mo.

<h3>Na and na(n)</h3>
<p>
  Na is different than na(n)!
</p>
<h4>Na</h4>
<p>
  "na" is an allative preposition, indicating movement towards something. It is regularly elided to n' before vowels and it triggers soft mutation.
</p>
<p>
  Avoid using for time, unless it's to indicate the end of waiting as in "na vedui", "at last".
</p>
<p>
  Example
</p>
<pre>
  Thingol allu adhul na Dhor-Rodyn = "Thingol never returned to Valinor"
  athar dhoer lend n'Eriador       = "beyond leagues wide of Eriador"
</pre>

<h4>Na(n)</h4>
<p>
  "na(n)" is a prepositional genitive, used for partitive relationships. It becomes "nan" before vowels and triggers nasal mutation.
</p>
<p>
  This is a prepositional genitive, used for partitive relationships. It indicates a sense of possession or having a certain feature.
</p>
<p>
  Example
</p>
<pre>
  Melian Vaea, na nûr idh·Rodyn = "Melian was a Maia, of the Valar-kind"
  E·chên ereb nan Aragorn       = "The only child of Aragorn"
</pre>

<h3>Preposition + article</h3>
<p>
  In both the singular and the plural, the article may appear as a suffix appended to prepositions. This suffix has the form -n or -in.
</p>

<h4>Mixed mutation</h4>
<p>
  According to David Salo it occurs in nouns following the article
  en 'of the' (sg.)
</p>
<p>
  and prepositions...
</p>
<pre>
  ben  'according to the; like the' (sg.),
  erin 'on the' (sg.),
  nan  'to the' (sg.),
  uin  'from the, of the' (sg.),
  'nin 'to/for the' (sg.):
</pre>
<p>
  For example:
</p>
<pre>
  erin dolothen Ethuil 'on the eighth [day] of Spring' (cf. toloth 'eight').
</pre>

<p>
  <i>
    The following is theoretical and not confirmed:

<a name="demonstrative_pronouns" />
<h2>Demonstrative Pronouns</h2>

<p>
  In English the demonstrative object pronouns and demonstrative adjectives are the same, and most Neo-Sindarin writers assume this is also true of Sindarin.
</p>
<p>
  The near demonstrative adjective is derived from primitive *sĭnā > sen, and the far demonstrative adjective would probably be *sanā > san.
</p>
<p>
  The far demonstrative object pronoun is derived from *san(n)ǝ > san (ancient vowel unknown), and thus the near demonstrative object pronoun could be *sin(n)ǝ > sen (with a-affection) or sin (without a-affection).
</p>
<p>
  Since singular sin would collide with its plural, it is preferable to assume the singular near demonstrative object form is sen, perhaps by analogy with its adjectival form.
</p>
<p>
  It's not clear what the nominative form of the demonstratives would be, but if we assume that the -n represents an object suffix, perhaps they would be se, sa, pl. si, sai "this, that; these, those", as suggested by Fiona Jallings.
</p>
<p>
  For dative demonstratives we have assen, assan, pl. assin, assain "to/for this, to/for that" and so forth. These are basically the nasal mutation of an + sen → a-sen, but with long ss because single s is not suitable for the interior of a word.
</p>
<p>
  This gives us a somewhat complete paradigm of demonstrative forms: 
</p>
<pre>
              Independent   Object/Adjective  Dative

  near   sg.  *se  "this"   sen  "this"       *assen  "to this"
  remote sg.  *sa  "that"   san  "that"       *assan  "to that"
  near   pl.  *si  "these"  sin  "these"      *assin  "to these"
  remote pl.  *sai "those"  sain "those"      *assain "to those" 
</pre>


<a href="#top">[Top]</a>
<a name="relative_pronouns" />
<h2>Relative Pronouns</h2>

<p>
  Attested forms are scant: we have i, ai, and ir.
</p>
<p>
  <i>"The j-pronouns developed naturally into relatives. In this use the bare vocalic form [i] was most used in Eldarin; or else the bare vowels: [e] personal, [a] impersonal."</i> - PE23/114
</p>
<p>
  S. of course has i, but if it additionally used e, a as relative pronouns, these would in plural become ai and ae. So we could be seeing the animate plural reflexive pronoun here. 
</p>
<p>
  E is already attested as 3rd sg personal pronoun, but maybe it serves both functions. And it would also match the reflexive possessive pronoun: ēnā > ín, analogue to tēnā > tín.
</p>
<p>
  If this theory is assumed, then it may not be usable because the validity of the relevant paradigms in the late period is questionable.
</p>
<p>
  Regarding ir, its validity is also questionable, seeing as its Q. equivalent íre was replaced by yá. Everything else is Neo-Sindarin, naturally.

<h2>Grammatical constructions</h2>

<a name="genitive" />
<h3>Genitive</h3>

<h4>Juxtapositional genitives</h4>
<p>
  Function adjectivally and hence the second (modifying) noun is always indefinite.
</p>
<p>
  Juxtapositional genitives are always used for nouns in apposition, that is, two nouns referencing the same thing:
</p>
<pre>
  "ost Minas Tirith" = "city [of] Minas Tirith"
</pre>




<h4>Prepositional genitives</h4>
<p>
  <i>Old style:</i>
</p>
<p>
  Use preposition "en". "En" causes mixed mutation.
</p>
<p>
  Are used for possession:
</p>
<pre>
  "Haudh-en-Elleth" = "Mound of the Elf-maid"
</pre>
<p>
  Are used partitive and compositional relationships:
</p>
<pre>
  Taur-na-Neldor "Forest of Beech"
</pre>

<p>
  <b>
    New style:
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  "en" is only a definite article:
</p>
<pre>
  haudh arwen    "mound [of a] lady"
  haudh en arwen "mound [of] the lady"
  haudh in erwin "mound [of] the ladies"
</pre>

<h4>Partitive</h4>
<p>
  Partitive is when a thing is part of something, e.g. "three of my friends".
</p>
<p>
  For partitive, use preposition "na(n)". "Na(n)" should be indefinite and limited to partitive and compositional relationships.
</p>
<pre>
  "Taur-na-Neldor" = "Forest of Beech"
</pre>
<p>
  Na(n) can be used as a prefix an-. ?
</p>

<h4>Origin</h4>
<p>
  Use preposition "o".
</p>
<pre>
  "Celebrimbor o Eregion" = "Celebrimbor of [= from] Eregion"
</pre>

<h4>Recommendations</h4>
<p>
  Assume na(n) "of" is indefinite causing nasal mutation.
</p>
<p>
  with definite singular e(n) "of the" inducing mixed mutation.
</p>
<p>
  and definite plural i(n) "of the" inducing nasal mutation. 
</p>
<h5>CEA</h5>
<p>
  It is recommended assuming there are only juxtapositional genitives.
</p>
<p>
  With e(n) [singular] and i(n) [plural] marking the noun phrase as definite as in Welsh:
</p>
<pre>
  haudh arwen    "mound [of a] lady"
  haudh en arwen "mound [of] the lady"
  haudh in erwin "mound [of] the ladies"
</pre>
<p>
  Assume that na(n) would always be indefinite and limited to partitive and compositional relationships:
</p>
<pre>
  Orod-na-Thôn "Mountain of Pine"
</pre>

<h3>Possessive</h3>

<h4>Possessive Pronouns</h4>
<p>
  Sindarin has a set of possessive pronouns that seem to be very similar to, and possibly based on, the forms of independent pronouns.
</p>
<p>
  Most examples are from a single source, Tolkien's translation of Lord's Prayer into Sindarin: Ae Adar Nín from the 1950s.
</p>
<p>
  Based on these, it seems the possessive pronoun is formed by (a) adding n to the independent pronoun and (b) lengthening the base vowel, with the caveat that the long ē became ī as was usual in Sindarin’s phonetic history.
</p>
<p>
  Thus the following paradigm can be constructed:
</p>

<pre>
                        Sg.                    Pl.
  1st person            nín  "my"              mín "our"
  2nd person familiar  *cín  "your"                   
  2nd person polite     lín  "your (polite)"  *dín "your"
  3rd person            tín  "his/her/its"    *tín "their"
</pre>
<p>
  In all attested uses of the Sindarin possessive pronouns, they follow the noun and undergo soft mutation like adjectives.
</p>
<p>
  The possessive is marked the possessed noun with a definite article
</p>

<h2>Verb tenses</h2>
<a href="#top">[Top]</a>

<h3>Present Tense</h3>

<h4>Derived verbs</h4>
<p>
  The present tense is simply the unadorned verb stem:
</p>
<pre>
  gala "grow" (gala-)
</pre>

<h4>Basic verbs</h4>

<h5>Monosyllabic</h5>
<p>
  The base vowel is lengthened:
</p>
<pre>
  câr "do, make" (car-)
</pre>
<h5>Polysyllablic</h5>
<p>
  No lenghtening:
</p>
<pre>
  echad "shape" (echad-)
</pre>

<h3>Pronominal suffixes</h3>

<h4>Derived verbs</h4>
<p>
  Usually the final "a" of the verb changes to "o":
</p>
<pre>
  galon "I grow" (gala-)
</pre>
<p>
  In some cases the "a" is preserved: before -r and pronominal suffixes that were clusters.
</p>
  
<h4>Basic verbs</h4>
<p>
  The ancient aorist suffix "i" is preserved, and causes internal i-affection of the base vowel:
</p>
<pre>
  cerin "I do" (car-)
</pre>
<p>
  For many basic verbs, the vowel becomes "e" in an inflected present tense:
</p>
<pre>
    car-: present tense cerin "I do"
    heb-: present tense hebin "I keep"
    tol-: present tense telin "I come"
</pre>

<h3>Past tense</h3>

<p>
  Weak past suffixes of derived verbs:
  <ul>
    <li>-ant (transitive) or</li>
    <li>-as (intransitive)</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Joining vowel should be for inflected past tenses is "e".
</p>
<pre>
  teithannen "I drew (something)" or
  bronassen  "I endured"
</pre>

<p>
  Basic verbs use nasal infixion only for stems ending in stops b, d, g.
</p>
<p>
  l, r basic verbs should definitely use augments and vowel mutations
</p>
<pre>
  agor "did" for car- "do"
</pre>

<h4>Basic verbs ending in stops (b, d, g)</h4>

<p>
  These verbs have nasal-infixed past tenses.
</p>
<p>
  Frequently they have a vocalic augment that mutates the first consonant.
  <small>There is no augment if the verb has a prefix!</small>
</p>
<p>
  Verbs that began with ancient nasalized stops show their medial developments (to long nasals):
</p>
<pre>
  cab-       → agamp  "leapt"
  echad-     → echant "made"
  dag- [nd-] → annanc "slay"
</pre>
<p>
  When pronominal suffixes are added, it's assumed that the final cluster also shows medial development (to long nasals):
</p>
<pre>
  agammen  "I leapt"
  echannen "I made"
  annangen "I slayed"
</pre>
<small>
  (However there are examples from 1969 hinting that they may remain spirantal instead: agamphen, echanthen, annanchen.)
</small>

<p>
  Other basic verbs have a vocalic augment and vowel mutations of the base vowel, based on ancient vowel lengthening (later shortened in the final syllable):
</p>
<pre>
  a, e, o → o, i, u

  car- → agor "did"
  men- → evin "went"
  nor- → onur "ran"
</pre>

<p>
  In cases where the base vowel is i or (very rare) u, it seems the augment is "e" or "o":
</p>
<pre>
  nidh- → enidh "intended"
</pre>
<p>
  The base vowel remains short when pronominal suffixes are added:
</p>
<pre>
  agoren  "I did"
  enidhen "I intended"
</pre>
<p>
  If the uninflected past tense becomes monosyllabic from the loss of initial consonants, the mutation is a → au as in:
</p>
<pre>
  gala- → (strong past) aul "grew" (< ✶agālē)
</pre>
<p>
  This au likely reverts to o if pronominal suffixes are added, but it might remain long if the example ónen generalizes, as in:
</p>
<pre>
  ólen "I grew"
</pre>

<h4>Derived verbs</h4>
<p>
  Transitive derived verbs form pasts using the suffix -ant:
</p>
<pre>
  teitha- → teithant "drew (something)"
</pre>
<p>
  Intransitive derived verbs use -as:
</p>
<pre>
  brona- → bronas "endured"
</pre>
<p>
  Some verbs may use either past suffix, depending on whether they have a direct object. It's assumed any pronominal suffixes would use the joining vowel "e" and the final cluster would show its medial form:
</p>
<pre>
  teithannen "I drew (something)"
  bronassen  "I endured"
</pre>
<p>
  however, it's possible the joining vowel is "i" which induces internal i-affection on the verbal root:
</p>
<pre>
  teithennin "I drew (something)"
  brenessin  "I endured"
</pre>

<p>
  There is a class of half-strong causative verbs with suffixal -d(a) (< -ta) that have nasal infixed past tenses:
</p>
<pre>
  tangad(a)- → tangant "made firm, confirmed"
  nimmid(a)- → nimmint "made moist, moistened"
</pre>

<p>
  With pronominal suffixes these behave like derived verbs:
</p>
<pre>
  tangannen or possibly tengennin "I confirmed"
</pre>
<p>
  In fact, these half-strong causatives are the basis for the (transitive) past tense suffix -ant. 
</p>
<p>
  There are a few derived verbs that have strong pasts derived form the verbal root:
</p>
<pre>
  anna- → ōn  "gave"
  gala- → aul "grew"
</pre>
<p>
  Like Quenya, these strong past are probably irregular.

o + i
o + in

ui / uin:

It means "from the"
It can be used on singular

In fact, the sole attestation of uin is in singular:

[...] suilad uin aran o Minas Tirith [...] "a greeting from the king from Minas Tirith"

As for CEA... This leads us into the complicated and murky question of how definite prepositions work,
and how they may (or may not) relate to the articles in CEA.

One thing to note is that CEA does not in fact invalidate sg. i, it just reframes it as archaic and obsoleted by the paradigm Tolkien presents with en, which itself is the result of older i coalescing with the old emphatic inā.

So in theory we could easily see the older i and in survive in definite forms.

As for what it means, uin (and o of course) are used for "from" to specify origin (e.g. Celebrimbor o Eregion "Celebrimbor of [=from] Eregion"), which would usually be a physical place, but I don't think it's necessarily restricted to physical locations.

There is a tendency to avoid nan in Neo-Sindarin, but it is not necessarily well justified.
It gets murky when a definite form is needed though, since nia is quite a puzzling formation.

Looking at Sindarin place names that use genitives I'd say that there is a tendency to use nan when a juxtapositional genitive would result in two adjacent stresses.

So if you want a "guideline" for when to use which, maybe this could be a start.

I decided to maximise my use of definite prepositions, which I've often avoided before. I am using a somewhat ad hoc paradigm that only roughly fits attested evidence. I will only use special definite forms for prepositions ending in a vowel, with some exceptions; this is similar to how definite prepositions work in Celtic languages to the best of my understanding, and largely fits the attested forms. The definite forms I'm using are mostly derived with ✶i in singular, causing vocalic mutation, and ✶im in plural, causing nasal mutation. However, prepositions where suffixing ✶i would result in the same form as the indefinite form will derive their definite forms with ✶inā in sg. and ✶im in plural, resulting in the same form but different mutations - mixed (as per PE23/141) in sg. and nasal in pl.

    The forms I am using (mutations are voc. in sg. and nas. in pl., respectively, if two forms are listed, mix. in sg. and nas. in pl. if one form is listed): an (dative) > (e)ni, (e)nin; o "from" (< ✶ho, not✶aut) > ui, uin; nu "under" > nui, nuin; be (I assume < ✶bai) > ben, po "on" (< ✶pā) > poe, poen; mo (instrumental, < ✶mā) > moe, moen; fo "before (temporal)" (< ✶pʰā) > poe, poen; ho "before (spatial)" (< ✶kʰʲā) > hoe, hoen; gu "(together) with)" (< ✶wō) > gui, guin; mi "in" > min; di "beneath, under" > din. Note that for na (allative) and sa "beside" I elide the vowel before another vowel as well as before articles, so n' en- etc. I am also treating nia as an abandoned concept (cf.: 

submissions), so nan will have no special definite form.
