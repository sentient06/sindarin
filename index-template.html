  6.1 Additional verb classes
</h2>

<h3>Half-strong verbs</h3>
<p>
  Sindarin has a minor class of verbs called half-strong verbs.
</p>
<p>
  Half-strong verbs are a subclass of derived verbs whose past-tense formation preserves patterns inherited from Common Eldarin and Quenya half-strong verbs. The evidence is limited but consistent.
</p>
<p>
  These verbs were originally derived causative verbs formed with the suffix <b>-ta</b> (Common Eldarin <b>-tā</b>). Their past tense was created not with a regular dental suffix, but by strengthening or infixing the root, producing forms with <b>-nt-</b>.
</p>
<p>
  One of the best evidences is the verb <b>tangad(a)-</b>, meaning "to make firm, confirm" (< ✶tankāta-), from Noldorin (1930s). It's present tense is <i>tangod</i> and its past tense is <i>tangant</i>. Sindarin still have traces of this system in several ways.
</p>
<p>
  A more recent verb in the Sindarin development that serve as example of a causative half-strong verb is the verb <b>covad(a)-</b>, meaning "to make meet". Present <i>covad</i> and past <i>covant</i>. This mirrors the Noldorin pattern and demonstrates that the class survived into Sindarin.
</p>
<p>
  Some general properties of half-strong verbs are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>They are derived verbs</li>
  <li>They are typically causative</li>
  <li>They are formed historically with -tā (S. ending –da/-tha/-a in later forms)</li>
  <li>Their past tense formed by strengthening the root, giving -nt</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Example of a half-strong verb:
</p>
<pre>
  tangad(a)- (to make firm, to confirm)

  1st person - tangadan      - I confirm
  2nd person - tangadag      - thou confirmest
  2nd person - tangadal      - thou confirmest
  2nd person - tangadadh     - thou confirmest
  3rd person - tangod        - he/she confirms

  1st person - tangadaf      - we confirm
  2nd person - tangadadh(ir) - you confirm
  3rd person - tangadar      - they confirm

<h2>
  6.2 Past tense
</h2>
<div class="image right">
  <img src="past.jpg" alt="Confusing past tense (meme)">
</div>
<p>
  Past tense in Sindarin is highly irregular, because it can derive from Common Eldarin and other morphological changes depending on the verb.
</p>

<h3>
  Basic verbs
</h3>
<p>
  Basic verbs form their past in two main ways, depending on the verb:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Via vocalic augment + vowel mutation; or</li>
  <li>Nasal-infixion</li>
</ul>

<h4>
  Past with vocalic augment + vowel mutation
</h4>
<p>
  This is used for many basic verbs (especially those not ending in b/d/g). The basic mechanism is this:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add a <b>vocalic augment</b> (usually a-, sometimes e- depending on the base vowel).</li>
  <li>
    <span>The <b>base vowel is lengthened</b> and undergoes its usual Sindarin change:</span>
    <ul>
      <li>a → o</li>
      <li>e → i</li>
      <li>o → u</li>
      <li>a → aw if the result becomes monosyllabic</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The consonant after the augment soft-mutates.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If the verb has a prefix, the augment may be omitted (e.g. echad- → echant instead of edachant).
</p>
<p>
  If the uninflected past becomes monosyllabic, long ā → au, as in aul “grew” (though this one is technically a strong past of a derived verb).
</p>
<p>
  Examples:
</p>
<pre>
  car-  agor    "did/made"
  dew-  edíw    "failed"
  nor-  onur    "ran"
  sav-  aw      "had"
  bal-  aval    "had power"
  nidh- enidhen "I intended" (inflected)
</pre>

<h4>
  Nasal-infixed pasts
</h4>
<p>
  This is used mainly for basic verbs whose roots originally ended in p, t, k, which become b, d, g in Sindarin. This is the mechanism:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Insert a nasal (n/m) before the final consonant.</li>
  <li>
    <span>Restore the ancient voiceless stop:</span>
    <ul>
      <li>b → mp</li>
      <li>d → nt</li>
      <li>g → nc</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Sometimes there are both nasal and augmented alternatives (e.g., dag- → aðag and aðanc).
</p>
<p>
  Prefixes block augmentation (as above with echad- → echant).
</p>
<p>
  Inflected forms may use joining vowels -e- or -i-, but the evidence is inconsistent (e.g., echannen, echanthel).
</p>
<p>
  Examples:
</p>
<pre>
  echad- echant "made"
  ped-   pent   "said"
  tag-   tanc   "fixed"
  cab-   agamp  "leapt" (implied)
  dag-   aðanc  "slew" (alternating with augmented aðag)
  caw-   cawn   "tasted"
</pre>

<h4>
  Recommendation
</h4>
<p>
  Use nasal infixion if the stem ends in b, d, g (from ancient p, t, k).
</p>
<p>
  E.g. ped-, tag-, echad-, cab-.
</p>
<p>
  Use augment + vowel mutation for most other stems.
</p>
<p>
  E.g. car-, dew-, nor-, nidh-, sav-, bal-.
</p>
<div class="wrapper">
<pre>
  Verb: <b>echad-</b>

  Is the verb's final consonant b/d/g?
  Yes (<b>d</b>)
  Then use nasal infixion = echa<b>d-</b> → echa<b>nt</b>

  Yes (√KAT)
  Then omit the augment   = echant

<h3>
  Derived verbs
</h3>
</div>
<p>
  Derived verbs are more complicated because the past tense varies whether the verb is transitive or intransitive, has a strong past tense or half-strong.
</p>

<h4>
  Strong past tense
</h4>
<p>
  Strong pasts are rare, and only two Sindarin cases are attested: <i>anna-</i> and <i>gala-</i>.
</p>
<p>
  They are irregular, mirroring similar irregularities in Quenya and earlier stages of Elvish.
</p>
<p>
  These verbs form their past tense not with the regular weak suffix <i>-ant</i>, but instead with an old strong past built directly from the verbal root. They both end in <b>-a</b> formed from an old root-based past that is inherited (e.g., ✶ānē → ōn).
</p>
<p>
  No general pattern for these verbs can be provided.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>ōn "gave" violates expected Sindarin sound laws.</li>
  <li>aul "grew" is phonologically regular but treated as a special inherited form.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Besides the two verbs mentioned, we don't know which derived verbs have strong pasts. They are assumed to be irregular exceptions, not a productive pattern.
</p>
<div class="wrapper">
<div class="a1">
  anna- (to give)

  1st person - ónen  - I gave
  2nd person - óneg  - thou gavest
  2nd person - ónel  - thou gavest
  2nd person - ónedh - thou gavest
  3rd person - ón    - he/she gave

  1st person - ónef  - we gave
  2nd person - ónedh - you gave
  3rd person - óner  - they gave
</div>

<div class="a2">
  gala- (to grow)

  1st person - ólen  - I grew
  2nd person - óleg  - thou grewest
  2nd person - ólel  - thou grewest
  2nd person - óledh - thou grewest
  3rd person - aul   - he/she grew

  1st person - ólef  - we grew
  2nd person - óledh - you grew
  3rd person - óler  - they grew
</div>
<hr />

</div>

<h4>
  Transitive Verbs
</h4>
<p>
  Derived transitive verbs form their regular ("weak") past tense with the suffix <i>-ant</i>. This is the default and normal past-tense formation for this verb class.
</p>
<p>
  It likely originated from half-strong causatives, but functionally it is simply the normal past ending.
</p>
<p>
  If a derived verb takes a direct object → use -ant.
</p>
<p>
  Some -ant forms show a vocalic augment (a-, e-, o-), but this is not required and is not shown in most examples. Example:
</p>
<pre>
  carfa- "speak" → agarfant (augmented)
  
  but also expected:

  carfant (unaugmented — Tolkien deleted this form, but it shows the base pattern)
</pre>
<p>
  To form the past of a derived transitive verb:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Take the verb stem (teitha-, r[a]itha-, carfa-, etc.)</li>
  <li>
    <span>Add the suffix <b>-ant</b></span><br />
    <span>Optionally:</span>
    <ul>
      <li>add a vocalic augment (a-, e-, o-) before the stem (rare, not required)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>For pronoun endings:</span><br />
    <span>insert -e- before the pronoun</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>Optionally:</span>
    <span>Add medial development</span>
  </li>
</ul>
<pre>
  Verb: <b>tiria-</b> (to watch)

  Add the suffix          = tiria-    → tiri<b>ant</b>
  Inflecting for person
  Join with -e-           = tiriant   → tiriant<b>e</b>l
  Add medial development  = tiria<b>nt</b>el → tiria<b>nn</b>el

  Verb: <b>carfa-</b> (to speak)

  Add the suffix          = carfa-   → carf<b>ant</b>
  Add a vocalic augment   = carfant  → <b>a</b>carfant
  And mutate consonant    = acarfant → a<b>g</b>arfant
</pre>

<h4>
  Intransitive Verbs
</h4>
<p>
  Derived intransitive verbs form their regular past tense with the suffix <i>-as</i>.
</p>
<p>
  A verb can take <i>-as</i> when it is used intransitively, even if it otherwise forms <i>-ant</i> when transitive. Thus, the classification depends on use, not the inherent nature of the verb.
</p>
<p>
  To form intransitive past, the mechanism is:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Take the verb stem (e.g., rhitha-, egledhia-, ista-)</li>
  <li>
    <span>Add the suffix <b>-as</b> (optional spelling variation: -ast)</span><br />
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>For pronoun endings:</span><br />
    <span>insert -e- before the pronoun</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>Optionally:</span>
    <span>Add medial development</span>
  </li>
</ul>
<pre>
  Verb: <b>tiria-</b> (to watch)

  Add the suffix          = tiria-   → tiri<b>as</b>
  Inflecting for person
  Join with -e-           = tirias   → tirias<b>e</b>l
  Add medial development  = tiria<b>s</b>el → tiria<b>ss</b>el

  Verb: <b>muda-</b> (to toil)

  Add the suffix          = muda-    → mud<b>as</b>
  Inflecting for person
  Join with -e-           = mudas    → mudas<b>e</b>l
  Add medial development  = muda<b>s</b>el  → muda<b>ss</b>el
</pre>
<p>
  There is a single example with an augment, which could, perhaps, be treated as irregular, for practical purposes:
</p>
<pre>
  Verb: <b>carfa-</b> (to speak)

  Add the suffix          = carfa-    → carf<b>as</b>
  Add a vocalic augment   = carfas    → <b>a</b>carfas
  And mutate consonant    = acarfas   → a<b>g</b>arfas
  Inflecting for person
  Join with -e-           = agarfas   → agarfas<b>e</b>l
  Add medial development  = agarfa<b>s</b>el → agarfa<b>ss</b>el
</pre>

<div class="anchor_wrapper">
<a href="#past_tense" class="top">Past tense</a>
<h4>
  Half-strong pasts
</h4>
</div>
<p>
  There is a mysterious category of half-strong past verbs that use the suffix <b>-d(a)</b> in their present stem (because they come from ancient <b>-tā</b> causatives), and form their past tense with nasal infixion (<b>-nt</b>).
</p>
<p>
  These are the origin of the common transitive past suffix <b>-ant</b>, but half-strong verbs themselves don't use <b>-ant</b> — they use <b>-nt</b> directly. There is only one verb of this category attested in Sindarin, and 3 others attested in Noldorin.
</p>
<p>
  The verbs are these:
</p>
<pre>
  covad(a)- = "make meet" → past covant   "[made] met"
  lhimmid   = "moisten"   → past lhimmint "moistened, made moist"
  nimmid    = "whiten"    → past nimmint  "whitened, made white"

  and:
  eria-     = "rise"      → archaic half-strong past †oronte "arose"

  But eria- later became a regular intransitive past erias.

<h2>
  6.3 Future tense
</h2>
<p>
  There are two patterns for future tense: one for basic verbs and one for derived verbs. And they behave almost identically.
</p>
<h3>
  Basic verbs
</h3>
<p>
  If the verb ends on a consonant, simply use the stem with the suffix <b>-atha</b>. Then add the pronoun endings.
</p>
<p>
  When you add pronominal endings, the final "a" mutates into "o", just like in other verb inflections, except on the third person. Example:
</p>
<pre>
  car- (to do)

  1st person - carathon  - I will do
  2nd person - carathog  - thou wilt do
  2nd person - carathol  - thou wilt do
  2nd person - carathodh - thou wilt do
  3rd person - caratha   - he/she will do

  1st person - carathof  - we will do
  2nd person - carathodh - you will do
  3rd person - carathar  - they will do
</pre>

<h3>
  Derived verbs
</h3>
<p>
  If the verb ends on "a", simply add the suffix <b>-tha</b>. Then add the pronoun endings.
</p>
<p>
  Likewise, the final "a" mutates into "o" except on third person. Example:
</p>
<pre>
  linna- (to sing)

  1st person - linnathon  - I will do
  2nd person - linnathog  - thou wilt do
  2nd person - linnathol  - thou wilt do
  2nd person - linnathodh - thou wilt do
  3rd person - linnatha   - he/she will do

  1st person - linnathof  - we will do
  2nd person - linnathodh - you will do
  3rd person - linnathar  - they will do
</pre>
</div>


<div class="page">
<a name="other_tenses"></a>
<h2>
  6.4 Other tenses
</h2>
<p>
  In English, there are only two morphological tenses: present (non-past) and past tense. All the rest is formed with auxiliaries, and are not, strictly speaking, tense inflections. That dependency on auxiliaries is what is called a "periphrastic tense."
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, Sindarin only has three indicative tenses: past, present and future. Any other tenses in Sindarin have to be periphrastic, like English.
</p>
<h3>
  Continuous tenses
</h3>
<p>
  It's debatable whether continuous tenses can be achieved in Sindarin, because we don't have any evidence of it.
</p>
<p>
  Certain constructions can be made that emulate the behaviour of a number of European languages, like using past tense copula with present active participle, for example, to achieve what might be considered "past continuous." Example:
</p>
<pre>
  nîn hennol <span class="soft">barf</span>     ≈ "‹I was› reading [a] book"
  ni hennol <span class="soft">barf</span>      ≈ "I [am] reading [a] book"
  nathon hennol <span class="soft">barf</span>  ≈ "‹I will be› reading [a] book"
</pre>
<p>
  The argument here is that it translates almost seamlessly into English, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, and a number of other languages, and the translation looks a lot like past continuous, but we don't know whether this is a reliable way of expressing continuity or progression on its own.
</p>
<p>
  The chief intention of a continuous tense is to define or emphasise a temporal relationship between the main action taking place and another discrete event that happened during this action. This relationship can be expressed without grammatically bending the verbs into an unproven standard. For example:
</p>
<pre>
  lo hennen <span class="soft">barf</span>, lhassannen e·<span class="soft">'lim</span> lín = "while I read a book, I heard your voice"
  
  Literally:
  
  "while ‹I read› [a] book, ‹I heard› the·voice yours"
</pre>
<p>
  This is the preferred approach in Neo-Sindarin for past continuous. A future continuous can be expressed similarly:
</p>
<pre>
  lo hennathon <span class="soft">barf</span>, no dîn! = "while ‹I read› [a] book, be quiet!"
</pre>
<p>
  The present continuous is not a concern, because in Sindarin, the present tense can describe continuity on its own:
</p>
<pre>
  hennon <span class="soft">barf</span>, no dîn! = "‹I read› [a] book, be quiet!"
                       = "‹I am reading› [a] book, be quiet!"
</pre>
<p>
  Sindarin has no mechanisms for describing perfective, i.e. if an action has been completed or not. Context should describe it.

  7.1 Diminutive
</h2>
<div class="image right">
  <img src="diminutive.jpg" alt="Tiny Keanu Reeves (meme)">
</div>
<p>
  Diminutive is Sindarin is not very well documented, so this is rather speculative.
</p>
<p>
  Diminutives are probably caused with the suffix <b>-eg</b> (from < ✶-ikā, attested in PE23.)
</p>
<p>
  That works along with the distribution of <b>-ig</b> (< ✶iki, comparable to Q. -ince). There's another suffix <b>-og</b> of unknown etymology, which may represent a single unit of something. This one is unclear, but it is highly unlikely to be random.
</p>
<p>
  Examples:
</p>
<pre>
  atheg    = "little father; thumb"
  emig     = "little mother, mum"
  gwinig   = "little-one, baby"
  honeg    = "little brother"
  lebig    = "little finger"
  nethig   = "little sister, little girl"
  Nogotheg = "Dwarflet"
  toleg    = "sticker-up (middle finger)"
  lotheg   = "single (little) flower"

  Swadesh list
</h3>
<p>
  A Swadesh list is a compilation of forms and concepts which all languages, without exception, have terms for, such as star, hand, water, kill, sleep, and so forth. The number of such terms is small – a few hundred at most, or possibly less than a hundred. The inclusion or exclusion of many terms is up to debate and there are several different lists. The Swadesh list is named after linguist Morris Swadesh. Read more about it on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swadesh_list" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I have compiled a Swadesh 207 list for Neo-Sindarin. Not all words are exactly what it seems, and there are multiple candidates for several of these. All of them are linked to Eldamo or explained as appropriate.

<h3>
  Silmarillion list
</h3>
<p>
  Given that Sindarin is a language from a different universe, and thus the Swadesh list wouldn't contain names of other races and concepts frequently used in Middle-earth, I have also checked the most common words in the Silmarillion, bar the common language terms, then removed some proper names, Sindarin words and repeated Swadesh words and put the top 100 in the table below, in alphabetical order.

3. Modal verbs

(I don't think this is a thing)

Modal verbs are auxiliary verbs that express possibility, ability, obligation, permission, or likelihood.
In modern English, the core set is: can, could, may, might, shall, should, will, would, must.
They do not take -s in the third person, and they are followed by the bare infinitive (e.g., must go, can see).

Ability: She can swim.
Obligation: You must stop.
Possibility: It might rain.
Advice: You should rest.
Permission: May I leave?


5. Time expressions

There is some research suggesting that Proto-Uralic used diminutives to designate singular instances from words which are either inherently groups or non-discrete things.
Sindarin maybe uses diminutives that way too.

                      the elf [is] [a] king                                           the king of elves

PREDICATION:

Adjectives:
Definite   → "the elf is tall"
  tond en·edhel = "tall [is] the elf"

Indefinite → "an elf is tall"
  tond edhel    = "tall [is] [an] elf"

  tond nodui edhel = "tall some elf"
  tynd edhil       = "tall elves"
  edhil tynd       = "elves tall"
  edhil ti dynd    = "elves they tall"

This is ambiguous and IMO would sooner be interpreted as "a tall Elf" with the non-standard / poetic word order.
If the intended meaning here is that some unspecified individual Elf is tall, then I would add a quantifier "some".
If, however, the intended meaning is that if an individual is an Elf, then that individual is tall, then this is a generic statement and would be better in plural, "Elves are tall".
And there it's a question of whether we accept ambiguity in tynd Edhil / Edhil tynd, or we add a pronoun to disambiguate the predicative meaning, Edhil ti dynd.
Adding a pronoun is functionally useful, but unattested.


Nouns:
Elf and King are both indefinite      → An elf is a king
  edhel te aran    = "[an] elf he [is] [a] king"

Elf is indefinite / King is definite: → An elf is the king
  er edhel en·aran = "one elf [is] the king"

Elf is definite / King is indefinite  → The elf is a king
  en·edhel aran    = "the elf [is] [a] king"

Elf and King are both definite:       → The elf is the king
  en·edhel te en·aran = "the elf he [is] the king" (maybe?)

ATTRIBUTION:

Adjectives:
Definite   → "the tall elf"
  en·edhel dond = "the elf tall"

Indefinite → "a tall elf"
  edhel dond    = "[an] elf tall"

Nouns:
Definite   → "the king elf" or "the elf king"
  en·edhelaran = "the elf-king"
  en·aran edhellen = "the king elvish"
  en·edhel arnen = "the elf kingish"

Indefinite → "a king elf" or "an elf king"
  edhelaran    = "elf-king"

I don't think these are valid.
I would recommend rephrasing such things with an adjective:
(en·)Aran Edhellen for "(the) Elf-king".
The reverse, "King-elf", seems somewhat odd to me in terms of semantics, but perhaps could be satisfactorily expressed as (en·)Edhel arnen.



GENITIVE
King and Elves are both indefinite → a king of elves
  aran edhil     = "[a] king [of] elves"
  aran nan edhil = "king of elves"

King is indefinite / Elves is definite: → a king of the elves

  aran nan in·edhil = "[a] king of the elves"*

King is definite / Elves is indefinite: → the king of elves

  en·aran nan edhil = "the king of elves"*

King and Elves are both definite → the king of the elves
  aran in·edhil = "[the] king [of] the elves"
  en·aran nan in·edhil = "the king of the elves"


The two * should be used situationally - mismatches definiteness in genitives results in relatively niche or odd readings.

Compared next to each other to avoid dupes:
