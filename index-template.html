There is some research suggesting that Proto-Uralic used diminutives to designate singular instances from words which are either inherently groups or non-discrete things.
Sindarin maybe uses diminutives that way too.

                      the elf [is] [a] king                                           the king of elves

PREDICATION:

Adjectives:
Definite   → "the elf is tall"
  tond en·edhel = "tall [is] the elf"

Indefinite → "an elf is tall"
  tond edhel    = "tall [is] [an] elf"

  tond nodui edhel = "tall some elf"
  tynd edhil       = "tall elves"
  edhil tynd       = "elves tall"
  edhil ti dynd    = "elves they tall"

This is ambiguous and IMO would sooner be interpreted as "a tall Elf" with the non-standard / poetic word order.
If the intended meaning here is that some unspecified individual Elf is tall, then I would add a quantifier "some".
If, however, the intended meaning is that if an individual is an Elf, then that individual is tall, then this is a generic statement and would be better in plural, "Elves are tall".
And there it's a question of whether we accept ambiguity in tynd Edhil / Edhil tynd, or we add a pronoun to disambiguate the predicative meaning, Edhil ti dynd.
Adding a pronoun is functionally useful, but unattested.


Nouns:
Elf and King are both indefinite      → An elf is a king
  edhel te aran    = "[an] elf he [is] [a] king"

Elf is indefinite / King is definite: → An elf is the king
  er edhel en·aran = "one elf [is] the king"

Elf is definite / King is indefinite  → The elf is a king
  en·edhel aran    = "the elf [is] [a] king"

Elf and King are both definite:       → The elf is the king
  en·edhel te en·aran = "the elf he [is] the king" (maybe?)

ATTRIBUTION:

Adjectives:
Definite   → "the tall elf"
  en·edhel dond = "the elf tall"

Indefinite → "a tall elf"
  edhel dond    = "[an] elf tall"

Nouns:
Definite   → "the king elf" or "the elf king"
  en·edhelaran = "the elf-king"
  en·aran edhellen = "the king elvish"
  en·edhel arnen = "the elf kingish"

Indefinite → "a king elf" or "an elf king"
  edhelaran    = "elf-king"

I don't think these are valid.
I would recommend rephrasing such things with an adjective:
(en·)Aran Edhellen for "(the) Elf-king".
The reverse, "King-elf", seems somewhat odd to me in terms of semantics, but perhaps could be satisfactorily expressed as (en·)Edhel arnen.



GENITIVE
King and Elves are both indefinite → a king of elves
  aran edhil     = "[a] king [of] elves"
  aran nan edhil = "king of elves"

King is indefinite / Elves is definite: → a king of the elves

  aran nan in·edhil = "[a] king of the elves"*

King is definite / Elves is indefinite: → the king of elves

  en·aran nan edhil = "the king of elves"*

King and Elves are both definite → the king of the elves
  aran in·edhil = "[the] king [of] the elves"
  en·aran nan in·edhil = "the king of the elves"


The two * should be used situationally - mismatches definiteness in genitives results in relatively niche or odd readings.

Compared next to each other to avoid dupes:

aran edhil           = genitive indef indef                   - "[a] king [of] elves"       |
aran in·edhil        = genitive def def                       - "[the] king [of] the elves" |

aran nan in·edhil    = genitive indef def                     - "[a] king of the elves"*    |
edhel dond           = attribution adjectives indef           - "[an] elf tall"             |
edhel te aran        = predication nouns indef indef          - "[an] elf he [is] [a] king" |

en·aran nan edhil    = genitive def indef                     - "the king of elves"*        |

en·edhel aran        = predication nouns def indef            - "the elf [is] [a] king"     |
en·edhel arnen       = attribution nouns def alt              - "the elf kingish"           |

Verb lenition issue:

Why is pêd lenited in guren bêd enni while teithant is not lenited in Celebrimbor o Eregion teithant?

In light of the explicit statement in PE23 that verbs should be lenited after the subject, the current working hypothesis is that the lenition does not apply after complex subjects, that is subjects that contain more material after the noun. In the case of Celebrimbor o Eregion, the underlined part is an adjunct which may perhaps block the lenition.

https://discord.com/channels/397489292185960468/398407102344986625/1316100109204979802

I would say that verb lenition after the subject happens only if the subject is a single prosodic word, whereas here you have two, forming a phonological phrase without the verb. In simpler terms for anyone unfamiliar with the terms - if the subject is more than one word, the verb probably doesn't lenite.

https://eldamo.org/elvish-essays/late-sindarin-articles-and-mutations.html#2.0

Maybe relevant:

According to PE23 verbs following their subjects, nouns or emphatic pronouns. The pronominal subjects of verbs had been agglutinated to the verbal stems already in CE. The normal sentence order in Q., T., and S. was subject, verb, first object, second object. But order was probably freer in CE, and in any case the weaker unemphatic pronominal words were evidently usually subordinated to the important verb stem.
