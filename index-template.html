3. Modal verbs

(I don't think this is a thing)

Modal verbs are auxiliary verbs that express possibility, ability, obligation, permission, or likelihood.
In modern English, the core set is: can, could, may, might, shall, should, will, would, must.
They do not take -s in the third person, and they are followed by the bare infinitive (e.g., must go, can see).

Ability: She can swim.
Obligation: You must stop.
Possibility: It might rain.
Advice: You should rest.
Permission: May I leave?


5. Time expressions

Unproven prepositions:

Wrong type:
N. pref.<a target="_blank">ath</a>    + noun soft mutation = 'on both sides, across'
N. adv. <a target="_blank">am?</a>    + noun soft mutation = 'up'

Bollocks?:
<a target="_blank">athra</a>  + noun soft mutation = 'across'
<a target="_blank">ned</a>    + hard mutation      = 'in'
<a target="_blank">ter</a>                         = 'through'

Diminutive and augmentative:

There is some research suggesting that Proto-Uralic used diminutives to designate singular instances from words which are either inherently groups or non-discrete things.
Sindarin maybe uses diminutives that way too.


Word for "during":

mi + -llumë = milume = "during, in [this] time"

                      the elf [is] [a] king                                           the king of elves

PREDICATION:

Adjectives:
Definite   → "the elf is tall"
  tond en·edhel = "tall [is] the elf"

Indefinite → "an elf is tall"
  tond edhel    = "tall [is] [an] elf"

  tond nodui edhel = "tall some elf"
  tynd edhil       = "tall elves"
  edhil tynd       = "elves tall"
  edhil ti dynd    = "elves they tall"

This is ambiguous and IMO would sooner be interpreted as "a tall Elf" with the non-standard / poetic word order.
If the intended meaning here is that some unspecified individual Elf is tall, then I would add a quantifier "some".
If, however, the intended meaning is that if an individual is an Elf, then that individual is tall, then this is a generic statement and would be better in plural, "Elves are tall".
And there it's a question of whether we accept ambiguity in tynd Edhil / Edhil tynd, or we add a pronoun to disambiguate the predicative meaning, Edhil ti dynd.
Adding a pronoun is functionally useful, but unattested.


Nouns:
Elf and King are both indefinite      → An elf is a king
  edhel te aran    = "[an] elf he [is] [a] king"

Elf is indefinite / King is definite: → An elf is the king
  er edhel en·aran = "one elf [is] the king"

Elf is definite / King is indefinite  → The elf is a king
  en·edhel aran    = "the elf [is] [a] king"

Elf and King are both definite:       → The elf is the king
  en·edhel te en·aran = "the elf he [is] the king" (maybe?)

ATTRIBUTION:

Adjectives:
Definite   → "the tall elf"
  en·edhel dond = "the elf tall"

Indefinite → "a tall elf"
  edhel dond    = "[an] elf tall"

Nouns:
Definite   → "the king elf" or "the elf king"
  en·edhelaran = "the elf-king"
  en·aran edhellen = "the king elvish"
  en·edhel arnen = "the elf kingish"

Indefinite → "a king elf" or "an elf king"
  edhelaran    = "elf-king"

I don't think these are valid.
I would recommend rephrasing such things with an adjective:
(en·)Aran Edhellen for "(the) Elf-king".
The reverse, "King-elf", seems somewhat odd to me in terms of semantics, but perhaps could be satisfactorily expressed as (en·)Edhel arnen.



GENITIVE
King and Elves are both indefinite → a king of elves
  aran edhil     = "[a] king [of] elves"
  aran nan edhil = "king of elves"

King is indefinite / Elves is definite: → a king of the elves

  aran nan in·edhil = "[a] king of the elves"*

King is definite / Elves is indefinite: → the king of elves

  en·aran nan edhil = "the king of elves"*

King and Elves are both definite → the king of the elves
  aran in·edhil = "[the] king [of] the elves"
  en·aran nan in·edhil = "the king of the elves"


The two * should be used situationally - mismatches definiteness in genitives results in relatively niche or odd readings.

Compared next to each other to avoid dupes:
