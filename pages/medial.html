  Medial development

<h3>
  What "medial development" means
</h3>
<p>
  Medial development refers to sound changes affecting consonants (and clusters) in the middle of a word as it evolves from an earlier stage to a later one; or, what happens to consonants when something is added after them, as for example when suffixes cause consonants to become medial, so Sindarin causes some regular internal sound changes.
</p>
<p>
  In Eldarin, this mainly concerns:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Stop → spirant weakening
  </li>
  <li>
    Nasal + stop assimilation
  </li>
  <li>
    Gemination and simplification
  </li>
  <li>
    Lenition-like voicing and softening
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  This is a standard historical-linguistic phenomenon, not Tolkien-specific.
</p>
<p>
  Across real languages, word-medial consonants are the most unstable. They weaken more easily than initials, they assimilate to neighbours, and they simplify in clusters.
</p>
<p>
  Examples from real languages:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Latin vita → Spanish vida (t → d between vowels)
  </li>
  <li>
    Latin lupus → Spanish lobo (p → b between vowels)
  </li>
  <li>
    Old English habban → Modern have (bb → v)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  This is called intervocalic lenition and cluster assimilation. Tolkien deliberately modelled Eldarin sound laws on these principles.
</p>

<h3>
  Core types of medial development in Sindarin
</h3>
<p>
  The main mechanisms seemt o be the following:
</p>

<h4>
  Intervocalic lenition (between vowels)
</h4>
<p>
  When a consonant sits between vowels, it often weakens (lenites).
</p>
<pre>
  Primitive   Sindarin outcome   Example
  -p-         -b-                le**p**etā → le**b**ed
  -t-         -d-                ne**t**er  → ne**d**er
  -k-         -g-                ma**k**ār  → ma**g**or
  -b-         -v-                a**b**a-   → a**v**ad
  -d-         -dh-               e**d**elā  → e**dh**el
  -g-          -                 khō**g**o  → hû**[']**
</pre>

<h4>
  Medial clusters simplify
</h4>
<p>
  When two consonants meet inside a word, Sindarin often simplifies them.
</p>
<p>
  Stop + t clusters often become spirants:
</p>
<pre>
  Primitive   Sindarin outcome   Example
  -kt-        -th-               te**kt**a   → tei**th**a-
  -pt-        -ph-               thi**pt**ha → ti**ph**-
  -gt-        -th/dh-            ma**gt**ā   → mae**th**a-
</pre>

<p>
  When a stop follows a nasal, it becomes voiced.
</p>
<pre>
  Primitive   Sindarin outcome   Example
  -nt-        -nd-               a
  -mp-        -mb-               a
  -nk-        -ng-               a
</pre>
