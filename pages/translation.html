  Example of full translation
</h2>

<h3>
  Original text
</h3>
<p>
  Let's take this quote from Homer, The Odyssey, Book IX:
</p>
<blockquote>
  I was driven thence by foul winds for a space of nine days upon the sea, but on the tenth day we reached the land of the Lotus-eaters, who live on a food that comes from a kind of flower. Here we landed to take in fresh water, and our crews got their mid-day meal on the shore near the ships.
</blockquote>

<h3>
  Translation process
</h3>
<p>
  To translate that, we shall take it sentence by sentence. I suggest taking it in chunks divided by the punctuation, so every full stop, comma, colon, dashes, they should all split the text nicely.
</p>
<p>
  Then, we translate sentence by sentence and stitch all back together. In this case we have 5 parts. Here is the breakdown:
</p>

<h4>
  Part 1 of 5
</h4>
<p>
  The first part reads:
</p>
<pre>
  I was driven thence by foul winds for a space of nine days upon the sea,
</pre>
<p>
  Let's get some words translated first. Don't worry if some words don't seem to make sense, I'll explain the choices in the sequence.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    "driven" = [horn](https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-3427183865.html?neo)
  </li>
  <li>
    "there" = [ennas](https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-433074759.html?neo)
  </li>
  <li>
    "wind" = [gwae](https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-4071975747.html?neo)
  </li>
  <li>
    "pleasant" = [maus](https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-581851593.html?neo)
  </li>
  <li>
    "length" = [annas](https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-144352447.html?neo)
  </li>
  <li>
    "day" = [aur](https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-2784467005.html?neo)
  </li>
  <li>
    "nine" = [neder](https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-2822334673.html?neo)
  </li>
  <li>
    "sea" = [gaear](https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-3259339243.html?neo)
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  "I was driven" could be a past tense and passive construction. But there is an adjective *horn* that means "driven under compulsion" that might fit this sentence better. Let's use it instead.
</p>
<p>
  "Thence" means "from a particular place." We have no words for "thence". But we have an adverb for "there": *ennas*.
</p>
<p>
  "Foul winds" → we don't have a word for "foul", but we have for "pleasant": *maus*. We can use a negative to render it unpleasant: *ú-maus*. The plural of *gwae* is also *gwae*. The plural of *maus* is *moes*.
</p>
<p>
  The word "by" can be translated to the preposition ||prepositions||mo|| meaning "by (agent of), with", because Homer was taken by agency of the winds. Since winds here are indefinite, we use *mo* + §soft mutation§.
</p>
<pre>
  Ni §chorn§ od ennas mo §wae§ ú-moes = "I [was] driven from there by unpleasant winds"
</pre>
<p>
  "For a space of nine days" is a temporal expression. I think the word for "length", *annas* would be adequate here. We can also use the preposition ||prepositions||mi|| to situate Homer "inside" the length of time. A "day" is an *aur*, plural *oer*. We can use partitive ||prepositions||na(n)|| to describe the length of time made of days.
</p>
<p>
  "Upon the sea" can be translated as "in the sea". The preposition *mi* can absorb the article, becoming ||prepositions||min|| + §§§mixed mutation§§§. "Sea" in Sindarin is *gaear*.
</p>
<pre>
  mi annas nan oer neder miñ gaear = "in length of days nine in [the] sea"
</pre>
<p>
  The complete line reads:
</p>
<pre>
  Ni §chorn§ od ennas mo §wae§ ú-moes mi annas nan oer neder mi§§§ñ§§§ §§§gaear§§§,
</pre>

<h4>
  Part 2 of 5
</h4>
<p>
  The second part is tricky:
</p>
<pre>
  but on the tenth day we reached the land of the Lotus-eaters,
</pre>
<p>
  "But" is a conjunction. There is a neologism for the word "lotus" that we can use: *glorchadhu*.
</p>
<p>
  The "eater" part is complicated. I think this term, "lotus-eaters" should be a compound word. Primitive Elvish has a root [√MAT](https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-2898449047.html?neo) that means "eat". Many Sindarin words that have a food-related meaning start on *mat-* or *mad-*. A "lotus-eater" can be construed as *mad-* + *glorchadhu*. The *-d* + *gl-* yields a *-dl-*, thus *madlorchadhu*. Plural *medlorchadhu* (still multiple eaters, but one lotus.)
</p>
<p>
  So our list of words goes:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    "approach" = [anglenna-](https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1686866509.html?neo)
  </li>
  <li>
    "land" = [dôr](https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-3950740861.html?neo) (nd-)
  </li>
  <li>
    "lotus-eaters" = medlorchadhu
  </li>
</ol>
<pre>
  ach §min§vin§ aur §paenui§baenui§ anglennannef §dôr§ndôr§ e·medlorchadhu
</pre>

<h4>
  Part 3 of 5
</h4>
<p>
  Part 3 says:
</p>
<pre>
  who live on a food that comes from a kind of flower.
</pre>
<p>
  There is no word for "kind." Looking at different languages, this term seem to come from rather varied etymologies. In many European languages it seems to be related to "family" and the idea of "beget." There is a root [√NŌ/ONO](https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1599616155.html) meaning "beget" that can be used, and J.R.R. Tolkien seemed to lean in favour of the same root in Quenya *nostalë*. So the best idea so far is to extend the meaning of *nûr* ("race") to mean "type" or "kind".
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    "to live" = [cuia-](https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1983781483.html?neo)
  </li>
  <li>
    "food" = [math](https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-3475842805.html?neo)
  </li>
  <li>
    "kind" = [nûr](https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1360627025.html?neo)
  </li>
  <li>
    "flower" = [elloth](https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1307503003.html?neo)
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Now we can write this:
</p>
<pre>
  i cuiar §mo§vo§ §math§vath§ i cernin o nûr elloth
</pre>

<h4>
  Part 4 of 5
</h4>
<p>
  The last bit starts with:
</p>
<pre>
  Here we landed to take in fresh water,
</pre>
<p>
  "Here" is not the place where the speaker is, so we will change to "there."
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    "there" = [ennas](https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-433074759.html?neo)
  </li>
  <li>
    "to approach" = [anglenna-](https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1686866509.html?neo)
  </li>
  <li>
    "to take, lay hold of" = [nab-](https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-4102772263.html?neo)
  </li>
  <li>
    "water" = [nen](https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-3687268913.html?neo)
  </li>
  <li>
    "fresh" = [laew](https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1278502481.html?neo)
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  The full sentence:
</p>
<pre>
  ennas anglennassef an nabed nen laew,
</pre>

<h4>
  Part 5 of 5
</h4>
<p>
  The last bit is a bit longer:
</p>
<pre>
  and our crews got their mid-day meal on the shore near the ships.
</pre>
<p>
  There is a neologism for "crew": *hoth*. "Mid-day meal" has a (neologism) word of its own: *nedhwad*.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    "crew" = hoth
  </li>
  <li>
    "to get, obtain" = [ged-](https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-4211148585.html?neo) (nd-)
  </li>
  <li>
    "lunch" = [nedhwad](https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-2196970125.html?neo)
  </li>
  <li>
    "shore" = [falas](https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-2051564789.html?neo)
  </li>
  <li>
    "ship" = [cair](https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1507132685.html?neo)
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Pay attention to the mutations used by the prepositions:
</p>
<pre>
  ah in·§§hyth§chyth§§ mín engenner i·nedhwaid §tín§dín§ bo falas §s'§h'§i·§§hîr§chîr§§
</pre>
