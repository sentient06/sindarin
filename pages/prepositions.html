<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
  Prepositions in Sindarin are numerous, but not exhaustive. Many are neologisms.
</p>
<p>
  They are lenited when used adverbially immediately after a verb, and they cause a number of mutations of their own, since a number of them absorb the article.
</p>
<p>
  Prepositions are normally monosyllabic.
</p>
<p>
  There are different prepositions that look very similar and have partially coalesced, but have very different meanings.
