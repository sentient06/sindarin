<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
  Sindarin genitive is made by juxtaposition. By positioning nouns next to each other, a genitive chain is implied.
</p>
<p>
  In a chain like that, the first item is called the head noun. And only the final noun determines the definiteness of the entire construction.
</p>
<p>
  Adjectives can be used in a genitive chain, but they need to be outside the chain and agree with their corresponding noun. If every noun has an adjective, they show up in reverse order.
</p>
<p>
  Some genitives can be formed by using prepositions.
</p>
<p>
  Examples of genitive:
</p>
<pre>
  aran Moria = "King [of] Moria"
  bar en·aran luin  = "the blue house of the king"
  roch <span class="soft">vaer</span> nan aran = "good horse of a king"
</pre>
