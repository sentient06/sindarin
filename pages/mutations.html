<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
  Many words in Sindarin change sounds when spoken in a certain sequence.
</p>
<p>
  These changes are known as consonant mutations. These apply to the initial consonant of a word.
</p>
<p>
  Sindarin has about six types of consonant mutations: <span class="soft">soft</span>, <span class="nasal">nasal</span>, <span class="mixed">mixed</span>, <span class="stop">stop</span>, <span class="liquid">liquid</span>, and <span class="sibilant">sibilant</span>.  Examples:
</p>
<pre>
  Soft:
  bâr    = "house" → <span class="soft">vâr</span>
  
  Nasal:
  bâr    = "house" → <span class="nasal">mâr</span>
  
  Mixed:
  bâr    = "house" → <span class="mixed">mbar</span>
  
  Stop:
  galad  = "light" → <span class="stop">ñgalad</span>
  
  Liquid:
  galadh = "tree"  → <span class="liquid">'aladh'</span>
  
  Sibilant:
  loss   = "snow"  → <span class="sibilant">lhoss</span>
</pre>
