<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
  Nouns in Sindarin are inflected into plural through vowel mutations. There is also a class plural and a fossilised dual form.
</p>
<p>
  The mutation that causes most plurals is known as "i-affection".
</p>
<p>
  Most diphthongs are immune to i-affection except in monosyllables.
