The following is theoretical and not confirmed:

Prepositions didn't mutate their objects, considering "vi Menel" as well.

<p>
  Prepositions are parts of speech that show relationships between words in a sentence.
</p>
<p>
  They often indicate where, when, why, or how something happens.
</p>
<p>
  In Sindarin, when a preposition is used **adverbially and follows immediately after a verb or the zero copula**, it undergoes §s{soft mutation}.

<p>
  All prepositions that end in a **vowel** cause §s{soft mutation}.
</p>
<p>
  Most that end in a consonant also cause soft mutation, but some prepositions that ended in a consonant back in Common Eldarin cause different mutations.
</p>
<p>
  Prepositions are generally <abbr title="A monosyllabic word having no stress or accent and pronounced as a prefix of the following word">proclitic</abbr>, so e.g. **mîn** and **trî** and **mîg** can be shortened.
</p>
<p>
  Some experts also think that prepositions are *prosodically conditioned* in Sindarin. That means that the mutation depends on sound-structure (prosody), not on syntax alone; so if the preposition is prosodically independent (pause, emphasis, rhythmic break), mutation may not occur, even if syntax would allow it.

<h4>
  Definite prepositional forms
</h4>
<p>
  Prepositions typically deal with indefinite objects. For example, "mi §s{ham}" translates to "in **a** room". To mark the room as a particular room, the preposition (mi) requires an article.
</p>
<p>
  In both the singular and the plural, the article may appear as a suffix appended to prepositions. This suffix normally has the form **-n** or **-in**, but it might look a bit different depending on phonetic rules.
