<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
  Sindarin verbs have three indicative tenses: past, present and future, and are inflected for tense, number and person.
</p>
<p>
  There are three verb classes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Basic (i-stem);</li>
  <li>Derived (a-stem); and</li>
  <li>Half-strong verbs.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The verb class determines how the verb is conjugated.
</p>
<p>
  Verbs can also be used as verbal nouns, made into <b>active</b> participles, and <b>passive</b> participles.
</p>
<p>
  There are a few irregular verbs, and some defective verbs. There is a group of impersonal verbs that use the third person.
